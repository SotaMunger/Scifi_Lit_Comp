The moment Nora stepped out of the train she regretted her decision. The large open space she had entered was filled with people, far more than she had thought. She couldn’t see much of the ship from here just a large slab of metal splattered with panels and equipment and several large open doors. This was one of two entrances with the other being on the far side of the vessel. A hundred people hadn’t sounded like much, especially after seeing the size of the ship she would be spending the next year of her life on. Nora had thought she would have plenty of space to herself. She could already tell how wrong she was. It wasn’t even the number of people, most of whom were government officials and dock workers, but more the other passengers were what gave Nora concern. She could tell who were passengers by their clothing, official “crew uniforms” designed by the organisers to “promote unity.” Anyone wearing a dark grey jacket with a thick blue stripe on the left breast side was going on the Argonaut with her.

               They were just so… eager. Milling about, talking to everyone, pointing and directing luggage around like they’re someone important. It looked like most of the passengers were entering from the same dock but most of the people here were officials checking the ship’s systems or the traveller’s luggage and identification. One of them walked over to her and she quickly got rid of him, flashing her ID and explaining she had no more luggage then the bag she held. Others weren’t having as much of an easy time, the dock was filled with noise. This isn’t what Nora expected at all.

               It was about three months ago that she heard about the experiment. The government boasted that soon the Verian Empire would have deep-space colonies throughout the known galaxy, expanding beyond the limitations of habitable planets the Empire had already exhausted, and even satellites and starbases. They revealed a new class of starship: the 313, deep-space class vessel. Concern grew, however, about deep space living. Even satellite and starbase workers returned home every few months to avoid physical and mental issues but to live permanently in space? To eat and use only what they grow themselves? Surely there would be problems. So to quell the public fear they designed an experiment, sending a hundred people out on a 313 alone for a year with no communication from the Empire, or family. No control over where the ship goes, just a year existing in space.

There were three ships, five were completed, but they didn’t want to risk them all. The Argonaut was colour-coded blue, the Paralus green, and the Olympius red. There was the option of randomly choosing participants but in the end the Empire had more than enough volunteers. There was a short and random selection project for the experiment. The only requirements were an expected lifespan of at least a year and basic physical and mental health. There were many reasons Nora could think of to join such an experiment, free accommodation, escape from overcrowded lower class colonies, adventure of for the challenge. For Nora it was all about solitude.

               No matter where you went there was always people, and in the over-populated Verian Empire that was just a fact of life. Even at the job she found sorting old files into new systems she was surprised to find she shared a small office with two other people. Nora spent most of her time working from home. Even then thought the three-room apartment was shared with three other people. There was just not enough space. She had spent the last few years living on a mid-sector planet named Archania c, far enough away from the capital to avoid large events and traffic but not too far as to be in dangerous territory. Even then it was packed with people, every planet was, it had been five centuries since they colonised the last empty habitable planet and a few decades since they gave up on the space colony program, sort of. Even the ship ride there was packed, no vessel capable of jumping sectors was private except for the ones used by the government or military.

               So the opportunity to disappear for a year and be alone on a space ship? Perfect. And even if there were another ninety-nine people on board the Argonaut was big enough to hold three times as many and still have space to spare. But as Nora looked around at the others on the dock she worried privacy might not be their priority. Nora was good at reading people, she could get a sense of person just by looking at them and an even better sense by seeing how they interact. The most prominent presence was a women in her late-thirties, just younger than Nora, arguing loudly with the workers over how they handled her luggage. Nora could tell from the luggage and the woman’s clothes she was used to high-class treatment. This woman was the kind of person who never grew past three, a brat. Nora wondered why she agreed to come on the experiment in the first place, perhaps an adventurous husband had brought her along. Or perhaps those who knew her found it the only way to get rid of her.

               Nora quickly walked past the commotion, and tried to find someone that gave her hope for the next year. There was a small young man, probably in his late teens, who looked terrified of everything and kept making quick glances to the exit as if looking for an escape. There was another woman with a pleasant look on her face in a conversation with an emphatic man who was gesturing wildly. There was a quick flash in her eyes every now and then that gave Nora the impression she was seriously considering throwing him off the docks. Nora was considering whether to try and save the poor woman when another man brushed past her, rushing off towards the entrance. He wasn’t wearing a jacket but he was running towards the open doors. From the brief encounter Nora got a good look at his face. Bright eyes, clear skin, perfect hair, and a cheeky smile that gave Nora the impression that he was exactly the kind of smug, entitled, upper-class idiot she had hoped to avoid. She decided it was time to board the Argonaut, find the emptiest corner and stay there for a year. However, as she got closer she saw another passenger. A man with a pristine uniform and large glasses, arguing with an official about his luggage. Nora considered ignoring it but her empathetic instincts, and the knowledge that she would have to talk to people at some point in the next year, made her walk over.

               The government official was large and intimidating, and Nora had to admit she was impressed the smaller man was standing up for himself. As she got closer she could hear them. “You were told before, only one large suitcase allowed, no exceptions,” the official explained for what sounded like the hundredth time

               “You don’t understand,” the other passenger pleaded, wringing his hands, “I can’t spend a year with only half of this stuff, its important!” He sounded to Nora a bit selfish, no one else brought too much luggage, but she got a good vibe from him, and he sounded less like he thought himself better than others and more like he was put in an impossible situation. “Is everything alright?” She said at a distance

               “Um…” the passenger ran his hands through his hair, the wild mop his only un-groomed feature, “yeah, yeah I’m fine, uh… thank you”

               “He’s trying to bring double the allowed luggage,” the official told her, exaggerating the severity

               “No he’s not,” Nora said innocently

               “What?” the two man spoke simultaneously

               “This one’s mine,” Nora played the fool, grabbing the handle of one suitcase which was much heavier than she had anticipated

               “Fine whatever, just get on board,” the official relented

               “Uh, thanks,” the passenger struggling with the heavy luggage until the official sighed with frustration and grabbed it out of his hands.

               Nora stifled a laugh before heading towards the door, pulling ‘her’ luggage behind her. The other man running to catch up, “I’m Isaac by the way,” he tried to make eye contact, and failed

               “Nice to meet you Isaac. You’ve got this right?” She handed him his suitcase, which he almost dropped. She began to walk away, and he would’ve followed but the heavy luggage anchored him, “I didn’t get your name!”

               “I know”

…

               The Argonaut was one of the largest ships the Empire had ever built, larger even than the massive Flagship-class vessels that patrol the galaxy. But it was not a military vessel, it was designed for civilians, farmers and the homeless. However saying it was one ship was not entirely accurate as it technically came in two parts. The engines and piloting systems were in a long section through the centre of a large ring. The majority of the ship’s space was in this ring connected to the centre by three elevator shafts. On three different sections the ring became thicker with each section with a different function, farming, living quarters, and storage and docking. This ring sat slightly behind the centre ship and had a separate power source capable of lasting far longer than the other. The centre ship being designed to dock more frequently than the full vessel as well as to serve as emergency defence while the more vulnerable ring stayed behind. Each model 313 ship was currently docked on Veria c, the second planet orbiting the Empire’s main star besides the capital. From here each ship would weave a path through the different sections, nebula and colonies of the Empire, testing both the ships’ capabilities as well as the crew’s mental and physical health.

               As Lt. Commander Malcolm Pearson looked out at the Argonaut he felt both envy and relief. Envy that he wasn’t making history in joining this adventure, and relief that he wasn’t going to be stuck on a non-military ship with strangers for a year. He had a duty to do after all, he was the Executive Officer, the second-in-command aboard the pride of the Verian fleet, the 310 Flagship-class Alcaeus. It was an impressive post, especially for someone of his age, but he and his brother had been groomed for military from childhood and he had excelled at that calling. Usually the ship would be out patrolling the Veil or keeping an eye on the at-times-rebellious outer systems like Eutropia. They’d been called back to the Veria system to oversee the launch. This experiment involved the regular populace, and was a sign of the future of the Empire, a test of its power. Which made it a prime target for what little resistance the people gave. They were small in number, and had no real victories or power to stand behind, in truth the only resistance they give is not being wiped out yet, but it wouldn’t be long as the full force of the Empire was searching for them. Malcolm had few run-ins with the rebellion and he had no sympathy for their cause, and no respect for their power. One day he hoped to be known as the Captain who hunted down those that remained, that would put his name in the history books.

               Malcolm heard his commanding officer, Captain Orion, join him next to the window. Malcolm had only worked with him for a few months, but he had heard stories of the fierce Captain Orion and the Alcaeus for years. He was the one who had kept order in the outer systems for more than 20 years, and who had ensured the rebellion was in the state they were in. He had never lost a skirmish, and never took a break. He was known for saying that his job would never be over as the Empire was only as strong as its military. “No issues yet?” the Captain asked stoically

               “None, sir,” Malcolm replied, in the few months of working with the man Malcolm had developed a strong respect for him, even more than he had for the legend he had heard during training.

               “Good, it’s almost fully boarded. It won’t be long, be ready,” the Captain walked away and left Malcolm to his thoughts. The Alcaeus was to follow the Argonaut out of the system for the first few days ensuring there were no malfunctions or pirates waiting to seize control. There weren’t many pirate vessels in Empire space, especially this close the capital. Even then the ships they piloted were rarely anything more than merchant or transport ships modified with crude weapons. Some deployed explosives through airlocks, others acted as battering rams with spikes attached to their hull. For groups like these the Argonaut would be an enticing target, a way to live a life outside the crowded Empire colonies. Away from the watchful eye of the Inquisitors. However, the Alcaeus could not follow the Argonaut for their whole journey. Not because of a lack of resources but as a condition of the experiment. In truth the experiment would begin in earnest when the two ships parted ways and the passengers began living their lives without government oversight and guidance. Because of the risks involved the ships’ paths through space were a closely guarded secrets. Even the passengers themselves didn’t know where they were headed. Only the highest government officials were privy to that information and Captain Orion was one of them.

               “Sir,” an officer interrupted Malcolm’s train of thought, “the ship is ready to launch”

               “Alright,” he nodded, “warm up the engines, get ready to follow.”

               The Argonaut’s engines roared to life, blue fumes ignited as the enormous vessel, the largest the dock had ever held, began to slowly move forward. A ship like this would rarely dock again, it would be too cumbersome. One wrong move and half the city would go up in flames. As Malcolm stared down at the ship leaving orbit, Nora stared through the small window in the docking bay door. Some part of her hoped that she would miss the crowded cities of the Empire, that she had something to miss. But all she really felt as the buildings grew rapidly smaller was that this year could not go by slowly enough.

The Master of Works led them to the interior of Skade’s comet, halting inside a modest viewing blister set into the interior wall of the hollowed-out body. Hermetically sealed from the blister was the comet’s main chamber, in a vacuum so high-grade that even the mild vapors leaking from the Conjoiner suits would have caused an unacceptable degradation.

Clavain stared into the chamber. Beyond the glass was a cavern of dizzying scale. It was bathed in rapturous blue light, filled with vast machines and an almost subliminal sense of scurrying activity. For a moment the scene was far too much to take in.

Then all too soon he grasped the scale of things and realized with a perceptual jolt that he was looking into a vast manufactory of sorts, where distant machines toiled with an inhuman efficiency: droves of sterile construction servitors traversing the vacuum by the thousand as they went about their tasks. They communicated with each other using lasers, and it was the scatter and reflection of those beams that drenched the chamber in such shivering blue radiance. And it was indeed cold, Clavain knew. Dotted around the walls of the chamber he recognized the nubbed black cones of cryo-arithmetic engines, calculating overtime to suck away the heat of intense industrial activity that would otherwise have boiled the comet away.

Clavain’s attention flicked to the reason for all that activity. He was not surprised to see the ships - not even surprised to see that they were starships - but the degree to which they had been completed astonished him. He had been expecting half-finished hulks, but he could not believe that these ships were far from flight-readiness. There were twelve of them packed side by side in clouds of geodesic support scaffolding. They were identical shapes, smooth and black as torpedoes, barbed near the rear with the outflung spars and nacelles of Conjoiner drives. Though their form differed little from the absurdly streamlined standard profile of most lighthuggers, he was certain that each of the ships was incubating capabilities no lighthugger was reasonably expected to match.

Skade smiled, obviously noting his reaction. [Impressed?]

Very. Truth be told, he was more curious than impressed.

[Now you understand why the Master was so concerned about the risk of an unintentional weapons discharge, or even a powerplant overload. Of course, you’re wondering why we’ve started building them again.]

Would the wolves have anything to do with it, by any chance?

[Perhaps you should tell me why you think we ever stopped making them.]

Skade, I returned to the Mother Nest only two decades ago. I’ve been too busy fighting the war to mull these decisions over.

[Still, you’re an intelligent man. You must have formed a few theories of your own.]

For a moment Clavain thought of telling her that the matter had never really concerned him; that the decision to stop making starships had happened when he was in deep space, a fait accompli by the time he returned, and - given the immediate need to help his side win the war - not the most pressing issue at hand.

But that would have been a lie. It had always troubled him.

Generally it’s assumed that we stopped making them for selfish economic reasons, or because we were worried that the drives were falling into the wrong hands - Ultras and other undesirables. Or that we discovered a fatal flaw in the design that meant that the drives had a habit of exploding now and again.

[Yes, and there are at least half a dozen other theories in common currency, ranging from the faintly plausible to the ludicrously paranoid. What was your understanding of the reason?]

We’d only ever had a stable customer relationship with the Demarchists. The Ultras bought their drives off second- or third-hand sources, or stole them. But once our relationship with the Demarchists began to deteriorate, which happened when the Melding Plague crashed their economy, we lost our main client. They couldn’t afford our technology, and we weren’t willing to sell it to a faction that showed increasing signs of hostility.

[A very pragmatic answer, Clavain.]

I never saw any reason to look for any deeper explanation.

[There is, of course, quite a grain of truth in that. Economic and political factors did play a role. But there was something else. It can’t have escaped your attention that our own internal shipbuilding programme has been much reduced.]

Yes, but I assumed that it was no longer a priority for us. We’ve had a war to fight and we have enough ships for our needs as it is.

[True, but even those ships have not been active. Routine interstellar traffic has been greatly reduced. Travel between Conjoiner settlements in other systems has been cut back to a minimum.]

Again, effects of a war—

[Had remarkably little to do with it, other than providing a convenient cover story.]

Cover story?

[Had the real reason ever come out, there would have been widespread panic across the whole of human-settled space. The socio-economic turmoil would have been incomparably greater than anything caused by the present war.]

Tell me.

[You were right, in a sense. It was to do with the wolves, Clavain.]

He shook his head. It can’t have been.

[Why not?]

Because we didn’t learn about the wolves until Galiana returned. And Galiana didn’t encounter them until after we separated. Both of these events predate the edict to stop shipbuilding by a significant margin, Skade.

Skade’s helmet nodded a fraction. [That’s true, in a sense. Certainly, it wasn’t until Galiana’s return that the Mother Nest obtained any detailed intelligence concerning the nature of the machines. But the fact that the wolves existed - the fact that they were out there - that was already known, many years before.]

I don’t follow. Galiana was the first to encounter them.

[No. She was merely the first to make it back alive - or at least the first to make it back in any sense at all. Before that, there had only been distant reports, mysterious instances of ships vanishing, the odd distress signal. Over the years the Closed Council collated these reports and came to the conclusion that the wolves, or something like the wolves, was stalking interstellar space. That was bad enough, yet there was an even more disturbing conclusion, one that led to the edict. The pattern of losses pointed to the fact that the machines, whatever they were, homed in on a specific signature from our engines. We concluded that the wolves were drawn to us by the tau-neutrino emissions that are a characteristic of our drives.]

How?

[How what?]

How was it concluded that the wolves were drawn to us by the tau-neutrino emissions of our drives?

[I can’t be certain, but it appears as all wolf attacks happened in interstellar space, along the more regular trade routes.]

He felt his irritation rising. There had to be more that Skade wasn’t disclosing. And that was enough for us to give up on building starships for good? And, more importantly, why haven’t the rest of humanity been notified? There have to be at least a few thousand Conjoiner drives still in regular use within human space if memory serves. Are th-

[Clavain, this isn’t even known to most Conjoiners, save for those in the Closed Council. Releasing this data would’ve done more harm than good.]

Look around you, Skade. We’re already fighting a war with our erstwhile allies.

Skade flicked her wrist dismissively. [Yes, and we’re winning.]

Clavain looked away, his frustration easily palpable. What now?

[When Galiana returned we knew we’d been right. All our fears had been confirmed. Therefore, this.] Skade gestured towards the main chamber.

The wolves are still out there.

[Yes, they’ve always been out there, hiding in the darkness, watching and waiting. For four centuries we’ve been extremely lucky, stumbling through the night, making noise and light, broadcasting our presence into the galaxy. I think in some ways they must be blind, or that there are certain kinds of signal they filter from their perceptions. They never homed in on our radio or television transmissions, for instance, or else they would have scented us en masse centuries ago. That hasn’t happened yet. Perhaps they are designed only to respond to the unmistakable signs of a starfaring culture, rather than a merely technological one. Speculation, of course, but what else can we do but speculate?]

Then Skade reached into his head and planted an image. What she showed him was pitiless blackness studded by a smattering of faint, feeble stars. The stars did nothing to nullify the darkness, serving only to make it more absolute and cold. This was how Skade now perceived the cosmos, as ultimately inimical to life as an acid bath. But between the stars was something other than emptiness. The machines lurked in those spaces, preferring the darkness and the cold. Skade made him experience the cruel flavour of their intelligence. It made the thought processes of the Master of Works seem comforting and friendly. There was something bestial in the way the machines thought, a furious slavering hunger that would eclipse all other considerations.

A feral, ravenous bloodlust.

Clavain looked at the twelve brand-new starships again. And now? Why start shipbuilding again?

[Because now we can. Nightshade was a prototype for these twelve much larger ships. They have quiet drives. With certain refinements in drive topology we were able to reduce the tau-neutrino flux by two orders of magnitude. Far from perfect, but it should allow us to resume interstellar travel without immediate fear of bringing down the wolves. The technology will, of course, have to remain strictly within Conjoiner control.]

What of the rest of humanity?

Remontoire, silent for so long, joined the conversation now. [We still have time. Maybe a few decades at most. Once the war starts winding down, there will be efforts-]

Skade turned towards Clavain and interjected. [And if we don’t have the time, these dozen will have to do. With the war on, this is the best we could do.]

I still don’t understand why we’ve suddenly begun shipbuilding again.

[As a purely precautionary measure, should we need them.]

Clavain studied the ships again. Even if each ship only had the capacity to carry fifty or sixty thousand sleepers - and they looked capable of carrying far more than that - Skade’s fleet would have sufficed to carry nearly half the population of the Mother Nest.

He looked at the ships, and focused on the drives. From his vantage point, little difference could be discerned between these and their regular counterparts, save for a larger profile. How many can they carry?

[Barely enough. However, we’re reasonably certain that there’s enough time to build more. Perhaps many more.]

Let’s hope that your estimates are correct, then. But what of the old ships that are still being used?

[We’ve done what we can. Closed Council agents have succeeded in regaining control of a number of outlaw vessels. These ships were destroyed, of course: we can’t use them either, and existing drives can’t be safely converted to the stealthed design.]

They can’t?

Into Clavain’s mind Skade tossed the image of a small planet, perhaps a moon, with a huge bowl-shaped chunk gouged out of one hemisphere, glowing cherry-red.

[They can’t.]

Has this information been disclosed to the Ultras, at the least?

Behind the visor of her crested helmet she smiled tolerantly. [Clavain, Clavain. Always so willing to believe in the greater good of humanity. I find your attitude heartening, I really do. But what good would disclosure serve? Like I said, this information is already too sensitive to share even with the majority of the Conjoined.]

He wanted to argue but he knew she was correct. It was decades since any utterance from the Conjoiners had been taken at face value. Even a warning as bluntly urgent as that would be assumed to have duplicitous intent.

[Do you understand the gravity behind your mission to Delta Pavonis now? We need the hell-class weapons, Clavain. Two of the ships plus the prototype will constitute a taskforce for the recovery operation. They will be armed with the most advanced weapons in our arsenal, and will contain recently developed technologies of a tactically advantageous nature.]

Like, I suppose, the systems you were testing?

[Certain further tests must still be performed, but yes.]

Skade unhitched herself. ’Master of Works - we’re done here for now. My guests have seen enough. What is your most recent estimate for when the ships will be flight ready?’

The servitor, which had folded and entwined its appendages into a tight bundle, swiveled its head to address her. ‘Sixty-one days, eight hours and thirteen minutes.’

‘Thank you. Be sure to do all you can to accelerate that schedule. Clavain won’t want to be detained a moment, will you?’

“Most certainly not”, he said, with little belief behind his words. To say that he disagreed with what the Closed Council had planned would be an understatement, but he begrudgingly admitted that their options were limited. He would need to resolve this; and he would, somehow.

‘Please follow me,’ said the Master of Works, flicking a limb towards the exit. It was anxious to lead them back to the surface.

The journey back towards the surface of the comet seemed to take much longer than the trip down had, and Clavain used this time productively, concentrating purely on the mechanics of the task in hand. The Master of Works bustled ahead of them, straddling the tunnel bore, picking its way along it with fastidious care. The servitor’s mood was impossible to read, but Clavain had the impression that it was very glad to be done with the three of them. It had been programmed to tend the operations here with zealous protectivity, and Clavain could not help but admire the grudging way it had entertained them. He had dealt with many robots and servitors in his lifetime, and they had been programmed with many superficially convincing personalities. But this was the first one that had seemed genuinely resentful of human company.

Halfway along the route to the comet's surface, Clavain realized what had to be done.

– Earth Days: 001 –

Alec can’t breathe.

Even through the water condensed around his ears, he can hear an alarm faintly blaring, its accompanying words too garbled for him to make sense of. Coming out of cryo-sleep is supposed to be disorienting, similar to what the brain goes through when succumbing to hypothermia, only set in reverse. He’d been briefed on it exhaustively during training, but at no point did they warn him about possible asphyxiation. Not unless there has been a significant malfunction on the ship that has been caused by a power outage and not unless the back-up generators have also been affected, but Alec figures if that is what’s actually happening at the moment, the ship should be well on its way to crashing or exploding.

What is the point of even waking up?

His eyes slide open, trying to peer through the dense water to see through the clear glass around him, but all he can make out are oscillating red lights overhead, and all he can feel is the ship rumbling chaotically around him, tempting him to close his eyes once more. Maybe there’s no way out of this situation, and fighting it would only stave off the inevitable.

His muscles start to relax in the small chamber, bubbles fleeing his mouth as he exhales outwards, before he feels the ship give a particularly violent shudder.

“You’ve been assigned to be captain of the Urania-O. You are the only one in the crew with any formal military training.”

Sergeant Penhallow’s words echo back at him as shadows start to drift across his consciousness, still seducing him to yield once more to an endless slumber. He was supposed to wake up once they arrived at their destination. Not before it.

“You’re also the only aerospace engineer on board. We’re entrusting you to guide the passengers to safety if anything goes wrong.”

Nothing was supposed to go wrong. Alec had performed all system checks in routine order several times long before they left Earth. He made sure every last wire had been in place; had taken the ship on numerous manual test flights; had verified the cryo-pods wouldn’t accidentally be triggered into thawing by random turbulence before they’d reach their destination; had even hand-picked their navigation droid. Only an extreme emergency should have woken him up, which he’s well aware this might be.

If that’s the case, he really is the only one who can fix this, and he’s simply losing time by allowing his mind to drift and drift, floating as aimless as the ship might be in space right now, instead of waking up and taking care of the problem. The issue could just be a matter of a panel loose somewhere, bolts that need tightening, any number of possibilities that are easily repairable. A quick space walk is all it would take, and none of the passengers would be any wiser. He’d been subjected to all sorts of scenarios during training and had cleared them all without problem, so there’s nothing to be afraid of.

Okay, stay calm.

He has to think through this. He at least knows something is wrong with his cryo-pod. The whole chamber should have drained of water, and the pod door should have automatically opened upwards the moment it detected he was awake. It’s hooked up to his vitals and set to respond the second it registers any physical changes that suggest he’d somehow fallen out of REM sleep.

There is an emergency release from inside as a back-up, one on the interior part of the door that he presses to open it. When it doesn’t immediately respond, he starts banging hard on the glass above him, hands balled into fists, his sore, unused muscles groaning with each movement. It still doesn’t budge, and Alec feels his lungs burn with the effort to keep holding his breath, his body starved for air. The ache sinks all the way to his belly, making him writhe in place as he panics.

His mind is already starting to fuzz back over, loosening its grip on all clarity and sensibility. Pulling him under, hypnotizing him into crawling down the slow-growing trench below his body, one so deep there’s no bottom end in sight. Just the obsidian embrace of nothingness waiting for him.

Gravity sucks him deeper inside, and within, he hears his sister’s voice, joyous, excited. She’s hugging him before her flight.

“Don’t worry, Alec, when we all reunite on the colony, Simon and I can have our wedding. You won’t miss out.”

Then his father and his mother, standing side by side, on the day he graduated from MIT.

“Your first love was always the sky… We could never get you to stop looking upwards. We’re proud of you.”

Jace laughing and bumping fists with him after one of their routine test flights.

“Always gotta one-up my scores. I’ll take you down next time.”

And young Max lying on his back next to him inside an old planetarium, both of their eyes pointed skywards, watching projections of stars rotate slowly.

“I want to see them for real one day, without all the smoke and dust in the way.”

Memories Alec latches onto, guarding them close to his heart, because he knows they’re all waiting for him. They were supposed to meet up and live peacefully in Kepler-452b –or as it’s now known as, Gaia. Start over anew. Thrive in a land that hasn’t been disintegrating before their very eyes.

Now, Alec won’t make it to Izzy’s wedding. Won’t get to watch Max grow old. Won’t get to argue with his parents, hear his mom nag at him about his love life, his father try and talk sports with him, trade barbs with Jace. None of that.

His pulse slows down, water pushing through his mouth and nose, shadows stretching further over his consciousness, before the pod door suddenly flies open, sending waves gushing out over the edge. Alec’s thoughts are still swirling in his head, and he feels like he’s breathing in thumb tacks instead of air, but he takes his first full breath in what feels like an eternity.

The ship’s human-shaped navigation droid is positioned next to him, mechanical hinges scraping together as it fixes the single red light from its oblong head at him.

“Alexander Gideon Lightwood, appointed First Captain of Urania-O by the Odyssey Research Institute, New York branch. In the event of an emergency, you were to be removed from stasis first. We have crash-landed in the nearest hospitable planet –Kepler-442b, located in the Lyra constellation.”

Alec’s still struggling to catch his breath as he climbs out of the pod. From what he can see, the other nineteen cryo-pods are all also offline and unresponsive, though the passengers have all been thawed out. That means they’re probably drowning in the pods as they speak.

There’s not enough time for Alec to process that thought as he scrambles over to them on weary, gelatinous legs and picks the pod closest to him. The external monitors surrounding it are also shut off, so he has no reading on the passenger’s vitals, and their body inside is too still. Practically catatonic already.

“Help me get them out!” he shouts at the droid.

“Affirmative.”

The droid’s heavy footfalls quickly march over to the pod, and the two of them work to push the door open, though it refuses to budge at all. Alec’s teeth grit together, muscles tensing up, fingernails pushing through the door’s creases, practically growling as he attempts again to lift the door. It still won’t budge. Which shouldn’t shock him. The pods had been designed to open electronically not manually, and some of the interior latches are too secure for him to even rattle loose.

“Fuck! How’d you even open mine?!”

The droid demonstrates by plugging one of its fingers into a port on the side to bring the pod back online long enough to open the hatch. Every latch inside releases, and water comes spilling out along the sides as the door hisses open.

The woman inside is blond, middle-aged, dressed in the standard utilitarian undergarments provided to all passengers – a short, sleeveless compression top and a pair of compression shorts.

Alec’s fingers immediately move towards the woman’s neck to feel for a pulse as the droid starts unlocking the next pod. There’s nothing. Not even the slightest hint of a throb, and Alec fights to keep his trembling fingers steady.

“No, please–!”

Before he can wrap his head around the possibility that every other passenger might be dead, a loud thumping noise erupts from pod #20. It’s offline like the rest, but whoever is inside is putting up a good fight to get out.

Alec doesn’t bother waiting for the droid as he runs towards it, looking for anything he can break the glass with. There’s a fire extinguisher hanging next to the nearest control console, one he doesn’t hesitate to grab before running back to the pod. The banging has already died down, and he’s fearing the worst. Still, he doesn’t let that stop him as he smashes the glass as hard as he can.

Pain flares along his arms and explodes around his shoulders as he strikes the glass again and again until it breaks and gives way. The body inside doesn’t rise up to steal any water, so Alec keeps smashing at it until there’s enough of an opening to drag the passenger out.

It’s a man this time, probably around Alec’s age. That’s all Alec’s brain registers as he lays the body on the ground and checks his pulse. It’s still there, but it’s faint. He’d probably been well on his way to drowning.

His palms immediately start pressing down on the passenger’s chest to perform rapid chest compressions to try and resuscitate him. He alternates between them and leaning down to clip the man’s nose and breathe into his mouth, trying to fill him with whatever oxygen he has left to give.

It’s fine. Take it all. Just don’t die on me…

His own heart is pounding fast, nerves awoken and on the edge of his skin as he presses down hard, keeps breathing. If he can save at least one person– please don’t die.

He can feel the man’s chest quiver under his hands, and he keeps pressing down, fastens their mouths together, exhales everything he has inside his own lungs until he starts to get light-headed. A few more pods have been opened, but Alec can only focus on giving CPR to one person at a time.

Several more chest pumps later, and the man eventually jolts awake with an abruptness that catches Alec off-guard. The man then twists to the side and starts coughing violently and vomiting out water.

“Are you okay?” Alec asks him.

A single nod is his answer, and Alec lets him catch his breath while joining the droid in removing the next body from pod #3, one that also has no pulse. It’s an older man, whose skin is already sickly-pale and slightly decayed, meaning he probably died long before they crashed. It’s not unheard of that some bodies simply don’t make it through the long cryo-sleep.

The rescued passenger from pod #20 slowly pushes himself onto his feet. “How can I help?” he wheezes out, still looking disoriented and barely conscious.

“We need to get these open as fast as we can,” Alec tells him.

The man nods and tosses the abandoned extinguisher towards Alec before running to find something for himself. He comes back with a large ax, which probably came from the utility room near the bridge. With it, he manages to make quick work of the next pod and tug the body free. A young woman –barely over eighteen from the looks of it.

“No pulse,” he reports before attempting to perform CPR on her like Alec did to him.

There’s not enough time for Alec to quiz him on his training and credentials as Alec pulls out more bodies and tries to see if any of them are even the slightest bit responsive, but it’s already been too long since they were thawed out and submerged. The average person can usually only hold their breath for a minute to a minute and a half. He’s sure more time than that has already passed, and chances are, even if they do resuscitate the other passengers, the passengers might wind up with serious brain damage.

Between the two of them and the droid, they eventually free up the eighteen other passengers and lay their bodies out side by side after several failed attempts at CPR. They all look like ghosts already, skin removed of life, heat, and color, eyes drawn shut, limbs not even twitching slightly. The only other survivor with him looks absolutely grief-stricken as he sinks tiredly to his knees, and Alec isn’t sure what to say or do to make him feel better.

His body is feeling just as beaten and exhausted, barely able to hold itself up, but sheer will keeps him standing. He’s still the captain. Still has to be the one to remain calm and focused even if the backs of his eyes are burning wildly with unshed tears.

Alec forces himself to lay a hand on the stranger’s shoulder to try and offer some vague sense of comfort, and the other man’s muscles jerk a little from the touch. “Did you know any of them?”

The man shakes his head. “My friends and colleagues were on the ships ahead of us.”

That doesn’t give Alec any relief. Just because the two of them didn’t know any of these passengers, it doesn’t mean they weren’t other people’s spouses, parents, siblings, or children.

And Alec had let them all die.

He’s not even sure how. The ship had a pre-programmed trajectory, the same as all the other passenger ships. They shouldn’t have run into any kind of interference on the way. Not when the previous flights had all used the same complex navigation systems to reach the colony safely.

It had to have been an equipment failure somewhere. The power could have malfunctioned due to an unplanned solar flare or they could have collided with space debris –maybe even skirted too close to the electromagnetic field of another planet or celestial body, which could have caused some kind of programming error. If Alec can get the power on the ship back online fully, he can review the whole flight log and check.

But he can’t move past the thought that he fucked up. He fucked up, and eighteen people are dead because of him. It’s all his fault. He was supposed to get them to the colony safely, and they could have at least been spared if the pods had opened correctly.

His body finally gives into the urge to crumble, collapsing next to the other passenger as he cups his own face. Tries to breathe. His lungs feel like they’re being crushed in someone’s iron grip, and he can’t stop wheezing.

A few tears slip free, and his muscles shudder hard, unable to keep it together like he knows he should. Unable to stay in control. The constant reminder that it’s all his fault walls his brain in on all sides, slowly moving inwards, making it hard to think of anything else. It should have been him who died. He had only been saved because he was the captain –the first in line to be rescued in case of an emergency. That’s the standard protocol for all flight missions, programmed into each droid’s internal processing core. It had only been doing as commanded.

The fact that the man next to him had survived at all is nothing short of a miracle. He should have been dead with the rest of them.

“...How?” Alec asks, his voice withered to shreds. He glances at the man’s face, finding his eyes beneath his damp fringe, noting their deep brown color for the first time. “How…did you make it? You would have been last if you didn’t start banging.”

The man’s eyes widen a little, like he’s also realizing at that moment that he could have very easily joined the other corpses. “I used to do a lot of freediving… I can go up to seven minutes without a breathing apparatus.”

Talk about luck. Alec’s sure if he had stalled a moment longer, he’d be completely alone right now. Alone and mourning over nineteen dead bodies.

Another shuddered breath leaves him too fast, his vision spotting at the edges until a hand slowly moves over his, the touch tentative but obviously aiming to give him comfort.

“Hey,” the man murmurs, his voice just as shaky. “It’s okay. Because of you, I’m alive.”

It’s the only consolation to all of this –that Alec had managed to save just one person. Although, he can’t really attest to how ‘saved’ either of them are at the moment. They’re not even in the solar system they’re supposed to be in, and the ship already looks like it probably needs significant repairs. He imagines they’re running on the barest hints of power at the moment, otherwise they’d be in the dark right now, freezing and running out of oxygen.

Whatever functions of the back-up generator still remain should have theoretically been sending power to the pods as well, and Alec will have to check to see why they aren’t as soon as he puts himself back together. As it is, he can barely stomach being alive at the moment even if it’s not the first time he’s experienced loss. The difference is that he feels more directly responsible this time.

The hand on top of his clenches with a little more pressure. “Just breathe… I know it’s a lot to handle right now, but you need to breathe.”

“I can’t,” Alec pants. “I can’t.”

The stranger abruptly shifts positions so that they’re facing one another, his warm palms closing around Alec’s face. “Look at me. Focus on me. What’s your name?”

Alec tries to concentrate on the face in front of him as it blurs and distorts. The eyes are the most hyper-vivid part of the other passenger, the warmth cradled inside reminding Alec of heated chocolate being slowly stirred. Alec doesn’t think he’s ever come across anyone who could express so much with so little.

Before he can answer, the droid pipes up with: “Alexander Gideon Lightwood, appointed First Captain of Urania-O by the Odyssey Research Institute (also known colloquially as the ORI), New York branch. Graduated at the top of his class from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a PhD in Aerospace Engineering, born September 9th–”

Fearing the droid is about to lay out his entire personal file to someone Alec has only just met, he quickly intervenes. “I can answer him myself!”

The stranger’s lips twitch at his response. “A pleasure to meet you, Alexander. I am Magnus Bane, PhD from Brown University in Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry. Born December 8th… I’ll let you ruminate on the year.”

If Alec weren’t busy trying to concentrate on breathing normally, he’d correct Magnus about his preferred form of address, but it’s the least of his worries at the moment. He’s more relieved that Magnus hadn’t been one of those billionaires who cut through the long wait list to get off Earth by sending exorbitant donations to the ORI. Generally speaking, those chosen as passengers tend to either be said billionaires, employees working for the ORI, or field experts to aid in Gaia’s exploration and colonization before they allow the general population to start migrating from Earth. Alec’s whole family had signed on for the Urania-series of missions out of New York, and Alec had made sure everyone else went ahead of him before leaving Earth on the last mission just because he had a lot of work left to finish to prep for the next series of voyages that would follow Urania.

For safety reasons, each ship can only carry twenty passengers aboard at a time, and because the hyper-accelerated speeds required to traverse that distance in a reasonable amount of time are more than the human body can endure, all passengers are put in cryo-sleep to keep their vital functions stable. The trip also takes about four and a half years in which the body is placed into a suspended state, neither growing, transforming, nor aging until it’s thawed out.

His family were closer to the front of the line for the Urania-series and will probably touch down in Gaia in about three and a half years while Alec… Alec is trapped in the middle of nowhere with a droid and a scientist. He’s not even sure how he’s going to get them back on course, considering they crashed all the way in a different constellation.

“Magnus,” he finally repeats after a moment, trying desperately to calm his panic attack rather than allow it to worsen by over-analyzing their situation from a logical perspective. “The droid said the emergency landing protocol selected the nearest hospitable planet when we started to experience technical malfunctions, but it’s hard to gauge how hospitable it is. ORI scouted a lot of possibilities back when they were looking for potential candidates for colonization and ultimately chose Gaia because the years are roughly the same in length as Earth and because of its ecology. You couldn’t find a better replica for Earth.”

Magnus nods as he slowly withdraws his hands from Alec’s face. “So you’re saying we may have landed on one of the rejected options.”

“They were programmed as back-ups into each ship’s navigation systems, so that’s my best guess for where we ended up.”

As Alec wasn’t awake for the crash itself, he can’t really say with any certainty. He still doesn’t even know what went wrong to lead them into requiring an emergency landing.

“The good news,” Magnus tells him, “is that we had to have landed on a hard surface, otherwise, we’d be plummeting right now. And also that we had to have landed in a fairly safe environment, atmospheric-wise, otherwise we’d be dead.”

That’s true. Though the ORI ships can take a lot of abuse from being out in space, there are some toxic environments that would burn up their exterior badly upon descent. He and Magnus wouldn’t have been able to survive penetrating the atmosphere, let alone landing, if they’d been on a planet with Venus’ level of volatility.

“Would you be able to tell exactly how safe the atmosphere is?” he asks Magnus in return.

“Of course. I brought some of my equipment with me onboard. I’d just need to step out at some point to collect samples. Assuming, stepping out wouldn’t instantly kill me.”

Right. Alec has to start trying to get the ship back online to check what their situation is exactly on the outside and to do more than wallow in grief and self-loathing. There’s still one person left to protect and to safely lead to the new colony. He can’t afford to give up now, not when Magnus is depending on him to reach his friends and family.

It’s still his responsibility to do what he can to save the mission, and the passengers are always the first priority. He can mourn the dead when they’ve both reached their destination.

“Don’t push yourself to do too much at once.” Magnus interrupts his train of thought as though he can already tell where Alec’s head is going. “Take all the time you need to cope and clear your mind. You’ll think better if you’re not over-stressed.”

Even if he had the energy to protest, Alec knows Magnus is right. He can’t afford to make any more mistakes, well aware Magnus’ life is now solely in his hands. Plus, his family will be waiting for him in Gaia. His sister promised she wouldn’t hold the wedding ceremony until he arrived just so they all could celebrate together, and he doesn’t want to make her stall forever.

He takes another calm, steadying breath before nodding.

Breathe, Alec… just breathe…

Her gaze remained fixed on the sky for a long while, the contrail of the dead ship she'd left behind echoed in her eyes. She was unable to look away despite how they stung and ached to close. Beside her, the corpse of the roc and its babies steamed as the heat left them and this planet's night cycle approached. Embedded in the mother's chest was the spear she'd used to slay her, and from it hung the string of fangs that Runite had given her. She reached out her one good arm, which was seated beside a broken collarbone and shoulder, and strained like she could summon it to her side if only she had the will.

When she failed, she looked toward where the lifeboat had disappeared behind the edge of the nest to land on the rocky shore somewhere beneath. With her one arm, she managed to drag herself forward a few inches. Pain annihilated her brain as every shattered part of her protested the motion, and when her consciousness returned she saw that she'd spit up a small amount of bile into her helmet and that the sun was lower than when she'd begun. But she did it again, seizing one of the protruding roots on the lip of the roc's nest and hauling herself up and over.

Her bones creaked, shrapnel floating freely inside of her body. An overlay on the screen of her helmet showed fractures in her legs, her ribs, her pelvis, her skull. Her lips and tongue were bitten clean through and blood crusted her mouth and tracked down her throat.

She tumbled from the nest and down onto a spined rock that drove all the air out of her lungs and took her back to the abyss.

Uataislurn, the genocide she witnessed just before they'd departed. The Cavalier. The criminal responsible, Marcus, and his cold face as he'd boarded with the capsule that would doom them. Then the first of the Queen's brood bursting into the world.

She was on a bed of sand at the bottom of the sloped rock, now some twenty or thirty feet below where the nest was perched. The suit told her what new injuries the tumble had given her but she ignored them. The lifeboat was in sight, waiting for her like an obedient animal as she struggled to right herself. It was harder to pull herself across the sand than the nest but the shifting cushion it provided kept the worst of the pain at bay. With every damp pull against the sand, the memories returned.

Tresses and the predators. Siwili, spitted limply upon the barbed tail of the Queen's servant. Runite tearing Marcus to pieces, and the purple marks on Edmund's neck where the parasite had gripped him. Red erupting from his chest before he'd fallen away.

She awoke again, grabbed another fistful of sand and pulled.

Runite standing on the other side of the glass in the airlock chamber. Meeting his eyes, feeling his strange, molten gaze on her. And the force of decompression that had driven them apart.

Sand spilled through her fingers and she whimpered, trying to hold onto the first half of the memory even as it slipped away. She mourned it, her cries small and sad as they tried to find their way out of her battered body.

The way Tresses had turned away from her, had crippled the way to the lifeboats bay so Nasira could not escape.

A death sentence that she'd deserved but never found. She'd abandoned Siwili, had been responsible for Runite's death. Now she was here and the ship was no more.

As she approached sanctuary, the cuff of her suit sang out cheerfully and opened the lifeboat bay so she could crawl up the ramp and into the cabin. It closed behind her, banishing the sounds of the grey planet's sea crashing against the distant cliffs.

It was over. Over.

The medical pod which she'd promised would save Edmund instead took her into its cradle, ravaged heat suit and all. A prompt appeared before her.

Initiate cryosleep?

Nasira choked on a laugh, causing the caked blood down her throat to split, and hit YES. The pod sealed and two warm, orange flickering lights in the pod's glass canopy indicated the sleep cycle engaging. Her arms went up as if reaching for something that only she could see.

And then she knew no more.

Telhub was more than a ship. More than a transportation facility. It was alive, it’s beating core constructed of immense electric systems buzzing and snapping as the masses of multicolored alien creatures hurriedly made their ways though it’s endless terminals. All of them were in search of the gate of the portal system that was supposed to take them to where they were supposed to be at the exact time they were supposed to be there. This was supposed to be Telhub’s purpose, fulfilled solely by Argon, the master computer who powered the entire facility, his leagues of anthropomorphic service robots, and a team of two very, very dedicated employees.

One of them was currently alone in a workshop, many floors below the central terminal. In the center of the bizarrely-organized space stood a green, lizard-like alien with short curved horns and a mane of cotton-candy-like pink hair. This strange, colorful alien was Neo, the last organic creature that Telhub employed. He had lived at Telhub his entire life, having been found abandoned there as a baby by two of the thousands of former employees, and he took much pride in the work he had done there. So much so that even after his adopted family moved on from Telhub to another planet, he chose to stay behind.

Currently his four jet-black eyes were intensely focused as he took a deep breath and slowly bent down to continue his work. He was repairing a rather large security camera screen, nothing too complicated. However he knew that the project’s completion would require the installation of a new Vigorite battery. Vigorite was a type of energy-generating stone and was used to power nearly every last machine in Neo’s galaxy as he knew it. Though not dangerous unless destabilized, Neo still took extra effort to ensure both his and the crystal’s safety. He began lifting the quarter-sized crystal with two tongs and was nearly successful in lowering it down into it’s port when suddenly the door was flung open and an animated voice called out:

“Neo! Hey Neo, I want to show you something!”

Neo jolted upwards in surprise, hitting his head on a hanging lamp in the process, and felt the crystal slip from his grasp and fall to the cluttered work table. Immediately he turned and saw a familiar frame in the doorway.

There stood Helios, a purple humanoid robot and another long-time Telhub employee. He and Neo had been assigned as partners decades ago and almost nothing had changed since then, aside from the fact that they had become romantic partners in that time as well. Currently his tube-like arms were outstretched and holding a piece of sketch paper that he seemed enthusiastic to display. However, upon seeing Neo’s reaction he shrunk a bit and asked

“Oh sorry, did I scare you?”

“No no, I’m good, I’m good.” Neo said in a strained voice as he grasped the part of his horns he had just bashed against the now-broken lamp. He felt around for where the crystal fell and placed it into a pocket on his belt.

“What did you have to show me?” He asked.

“This! A traveler just gave it to me. Isn’t it amazing?” Helios said, handing the paper to Neo.

Neo took the paper and saw that it was detailed with an incredibly impressive sketch of the interior of Telhub’s oldest terminal, one of the most crowded areas in the facility.

“Oh, that’s the main gate, isn’t it? Wow, did someone actually draw this? It's so realistic.”

“Yeah! They were from Benthos-9. They gave it to me because they thought the lighting didn't come out as they wanted it. I can't tell, it still looks amazing, don't you think?”

“Yeah, they even drew all the small souvenir stuff you have hanging around your desk. And it’s not like the lighting here is that great anyways.” Neo said, glancing back at the formerly functioning lamp hanging over his desk.

“Hah, how would you know anything about the lighting in the main gates?” Helios teased. “Aside from repairing portals you never leave your workshop. You know we live in a teleportation center right? You’ve got access to travel the entire galaxy but you spend all your time in this deep dark studio surrounded by broken things.”

“Well if you’re not interested in this deep dark studio I’m sure there’s lots more interesting things happening back at your work station right now.” Neo replied playfully.

“True, Xenon’s probably up there already filing a thousand complaints to Argon about me being absent and how it’s your fault somehow. Guess I can’t blame you for sticking down here.”

“Ugh, Xenon...” Neo said, with a tone of intense displeasure. “He just does all that because he hates that I’m head mechanic. And since we're partners I think he hates you by association, sorry.” Neo complained apologetically. “I dunno what he’s thinking, he’s only been doing his job for what, four or five decades, and he think’s more experienced than me!”

Just as he finished his thought, the intercom crackled to life and a robotic voice announced:

“Attention! Worker 26693 station 4 in sublevel control room c, your presence is needed on terminal A!”

“Sounds like you’re getting called up again, want me to come with you?” Helios asked

“Yeah, but aren’t you technically still on your shift?”

“Yeah, technically. Come on, lets go.” Helios replied enthusiastically, already walking out the door.

The two then exited the workshop and boarded the elevator leading to gate 1. As they were going up, the hundreds of aliens making their way through the facility were visible through the elevator’s see-through energy walls. Neo glanced down at them, scanning for what might be the technicial issue that he had likely been called in to fix. He couldn’t detect any, and once the elevator had reached gate 1, Helios and Neo made their way through the crowd to a tiny, familiar office.

This office belonged to Krypton, leader of the service department of Telhub and the voice who had spoken over the intercom. The door was small, unassuming, and surrounded by a variety of old, beaten-up travel safety posters. It certainly didn’t look like it would belong to one of the few beings who made sure Telhub remained functional. They attempted to knock but found that the door lifted up as soon as they approached. In the office they saw Krypton, a blue, humanoid robot with many floating appendages, all of which were currently occupied by papers and communication devices. Her face screen was glitching, a nervous tick she displayed often, as she was very often nervous, and she was so engulfed in her work that she did not look up as Helios and Neo entered.

“Krypton, how’s it-” Helios began but was immediately interrupted by another robot blocking his way.

“What is your business with Kryp-ton?” It asked in a harsh monotone voice. The bipedal robot had a very simple blue form, and Helios recognized it as one of the Kryptonites, a group of non-sentient robot workers controlled by Krypton herself.

“Ah, we just got a notification that-“ Helios started but was cut off again as Krypton dropped everything she was working on and sprinted over.

“Oh no, s-sorry!” Krypton stammered as she deactivated the odd kryptonite. “I-I’ve been having problems with the Kryptonites all day, I t-think something’s messed up their programming. Sorry about that.”

“It’s okay, really. How’s it going?” Helios asked gently.

“Ah, not great. There’s been a lot of m-malfunctioning service hardware today. I think Radon’s AI files have been mixed in with mine, and you know how h-hostile his Radonite team can be.” She said, still stuttering but calming down a bit. “But of course Radon’s far too busy with his ‘security protocols’ to help me. Though that’s pretty typical these days. Plus a bunch of portals have been malfunctioning lately and none of us can figure out why. And by “us” I mean “me” because all Radon has been helping with is this big presentation for Argon on why his security robots need more lasers.”

“Is that why you called us up? We can help you with that.” Neo asked, attempting to cheer the stressed android up.

“Hm? Oh n-no, Xenon is the one who needs you. I’ll be fine here, probably.” She replied, projecting a blue translucent screen out in front of her and skimming through the notifications it displayed. “Xenon told me to n-notify you to meet him on boarding ramp 1Z. It's portal has a-apparently been down for a while now so you should probably bring your t-toolbox with you if you plan on making repairs.”

“My toolbox? Uh...” Neo mumbled to himself, silently cursing how often he made the mistake of leaving it behind.

“I’ve got you, here it is.” Helios said as he flipped open a piece of his chest plate and pulled out a bulky blue bag with the number 26693 stitched onto it.

“How did you know I was going to forget that?”

“We’ve been together for 99 years, I saw it coming.” He replied, smiling warmly.

Neo thanked him but was slightly concerned at how predictable his bad memory was becoming.

“I've never heard about any problems with 1Z before now. Why does Xenon always tell me this kind of thing so late?” Neo said with annoyance.

“Hate to be the bearer of bad n-news, guys. To be honest, I've never much liked working with Xenon either...”

“Yeah, I mean if he really wanted to help me he'd stop hovering over me all the time. He gets frustrated way too easy!” Neo ranted

“And he's so sarcastic too... and angry... and mean. It's n-not great.”

“Well, we’d better get going if we want to get that over with. But hey, if you want we can come back and help you with this later.” Helios said,

“Oh, that’d be great. Haha ha ha. Ha. I'm so glad I still have you two working for the service department because I seriously cannot remember the last time I was able to actually enjoy something that wasn't related to work or portals or all of these travelers constantly coming up to me and saying things and asking me where to go and where their terminal is and what time our departures are and whether or not I think that everything is working correctly or not and if I like working here because every day I ask myself that question too and every day I come closer to not knowing how to answer it! I mean, right?”

As the blue robot spoke her face began glitching more violently and her voice slowly ascended into a strained, high pitched tone.

“Oh... okay. So terminal 1Z then?” Neo said with no idea how to continue the conversation.

“Yep! Saaafe travels!” She said with a stiff, unnatural smile plastered on her face screen.

Helios and Neo exited quickly, making their way down the long corridor leading to terminal 1Z. After a moment Helios said

“Do you... think she’ll be okay in there by herself?”

“I think so. Besides, what could we do? At the end of the day we’re probably just better off doing the work she assigns us. And we can come back later.”

“I guess you’re right.” Helios replied, though he still wasn’t fully convinced.

The pair continued down the massive corridor, now crowded with many colorful aliens carting luggage about and chattering endlessly. On their left was a vast wall covered in framed images of the Telhub crew members of the past. It served as a display celebrating the employee of the year for each year of Telhub’s 4 centuries of operation. However, Neo being the only non-robot still employed, his image comprised the majority of the later half-century.

They soon were stopped again, this time by another robot who resembled Krypton slightly in composition but was far more bulky and had a purple tint.

“Hey you two. Where’re we heading today?” He said in his usual deep voice and self-centered affectation.

“Oh, hey there Radon, just going to, uh...” Neo began

“Boarding ramp 1Z.” Helios finished.

“Right, 1Z. I was called there by Krypton a few minutes ago.”

“Apparently Xenon wants to see us there.”

“1Z huh? Never heard of it! But then again, im usually only working in the real high security areas. Gotta be protecting this place and everything you know!”

“Okay... well, see you later then.” Neo said uncomfortably, again not knowing how to continue the conversation.

“See you, I'm late for an appointment anyways. I'm displaying a prototype of a new gun attachment I designed to Argon. Here's my pitch, two words: Lasers and More of them.”

“Yeah, uh, good luck with that.”

They continued onward, with the crowd thinning out the further they ventured down the hall. This wasn’t surprising, as most of the portals at the furthest Z terminal were either rendered non-operational by years of extended use or left unfinished by the previous owner of Telhub.

“Hm, when’s the last time we were called to work on a portal all the way down here? None of this seems familiar...” Helios said. He then noticed that Neo still seemed slightly irritated and he asked him what was wrong.

“Eh, I don’t really like Radon. He’s worked here for the last 6 decades and he still refers to me as “the green one”. How hard is it to remember someone’s name when you have unlimited memory storage and five other sentient coworkers?” Neo ranted, feeling under appreciated.

“I understand, he’s not my favorite either. I can't believe Argon gave him a whole fleet of those Radonite robots to command. He’s not the most reasonable person, you know.”

“Yeah, someone should probably tell Radon that this is a transportation center and not a military platoon.”

Helios and Neo continued to walk and eventually passed one alien lounging on a bench, seemingly unconcerned with the action of the main gates. It was short, with teal skin and sharp, square features and was engulfed in working on a foreign looking computer. They likely had ventured this far to escape the constant noise and crowds of the central terminals so Helios and Neo didn’t bother to question them.

However, as soon as the two were out of earshot, the alien made the cataclysmic error of leaning against a trash can and accidentally tipping it over. It scrambled to pick the can up but saw that it was too late as three enormous Radonites in the area suddenly activated and surrounded the terrified alien. The alien, who was far smaller than it’s attackers, backed up terrified with its hands in the air. The Radonites prepared to apprehend the alien anyway and, realizing it’s chance to escape, the alien dashed down the hallway away from the scene with the three Radonites in pursuit.

“At least Krypton is nice.” Helios said, oblivious to what had just gone down behind him. “I just wish she wasn’t so stressed all the time, she doesn’t deserve it.”

“Yeah, and to be fair Radon is still a hundred times more bearable than Xenon...”

Suddenly, a smug voice from further in the darkness of the terminal replied
“Maybe so, but I also outrank you vastly so I'd watch your mouth, technician.”

Most of the Mars candidates had gone all the way out to Lake Bonney on a camping trip, with just a few left on maintenance duty at the station. The rooms were quiet at 3 A.M. when Ann got up from her bunk to have a phone meeting with her grad student in Cornell, the last one she would be shepherding through graduation before hopefully leaving her teaching duties for good. But after the call was finished, she heard a clicking noise coming from the direction of the station kitchen, faintly audible above the vibration of the station walls in the perpetual Dry Valley winds. Sax sat at the table with his laptop open, scanning through some data. That made two of them who were ignoring the psychologists’ recommendations, letting their sleeping hours erode under the power of the Antarctic summer light.

People did complain about the light, though not as much as they had about last winter’s darkness, and never enough to suggest that the person was experiencing serious psychological problems. Ann had finally figured out that light, in its superabundance or lack thereof, was a socially acceptable shorthand, a substitute for deeper griefs that had to be hidden from the selection committee. There must be people, for example, who came from close-knit families, who missed them terribly. Ann mind shied away from the thought, but she knew they existed. But that would poison your chances for Mars, you would be winnowed out on the next round. So you had to laugh and say, sorry, it must be the light it makes us all irritable, don’t mind me, it’s nothing personal.

Ann used the trick too, once she understood it, although by her own choice she’d had no family since she was eighteen, and she doubted the dark winter really affected her. Amusing, how her depression could protect her this way. The moods of black despair, the numbness, dissociation from her emotions, everything she’d fought so hard to keep out of the paperwork, had come round to serve her at last. Whatever damage the light was doing to her (and the effect had been studied scientifically), it must be happening in the part she no longer felt.

But: It’s the worst, to be this disoriented! she always agreed.

Ann had meant to go back to her room and start reading her student’s thesis chapter, but as soon as she saw Sax she stepped into the kitchen. She was helpless not to. And this was one of the signs by which she knew she had a crush, the others being that when she was alone she imagined long conversations with him, and that her face started smiling when she saw him, until he opened his mouth at least and was inevitably wrong about everything. She’d experienced these symptoms before, and had even let them get her into some awkward situations, back when she was younger and her unhappiness felt more desperate. But her brain, cunning enemy that it was, persisted in suggesting that Sax was something new and special.

He was more comfortable with science than with people, it was obvious in the awkward way he started to extricate himself whenever a conversation became personal. The ordinary gossip of station life was agony to him. And since he was emotionally inept himself, Sax would never belittle Ann for her ineptitude. He was safe that way, and safety counted for a lot. He and Ann could have a relationship—in her head, it was so easy—operating purely through science. Science, the only thing she’d ever loved that had never transformed into abusive shit.

“Hello, Ann,” Sax said, blinking at her in the kitchen doorway. “Do you, do you want coffee?” He peered around, looking for a mug and not seeing one. He had the slightest stammer, which no one but Ann seemed to notice. She’d mentioned it to Nadia, one of the few people whose company didn’t send Ann’s body into fight or flight mode, and Nadia had been surprised and sceptical. Sax always sounded so polished to her. Ann never brought it up again to anyone. She hoarded the knowledge instead, like a treasure belonging to her alone. Oh yes, a bad crush, a positive soup of irrationality!

I’m going to do something about it, she thought, as she thanked Sax and began to look for a mug in the drying rack beside the little sink. Today. I’ll ask him to go on a hike.

That was the code, in their little society. There were, of course, reasons to go hiking that had to do with science, or beautiful views, or mental well-being, but the fact remained that saying “x and y went on a hike together” meant a very particular thing, and Sax could not fail understand it.

I’ll ask him right now, while there’s only the two of us, Ann thought, though she’d made similar resolves before and done nothing. Everyone knew that Sax had gone on a hike with Tatiana Durova, who was movie-actress beautiful and, significantly, did not tower over him by four scowling inches. But Ann poured her coffee and sat down across from him. She couldn’t not; the thesis chapter was going to go unread and that was all there was to it. “How is your data?” she asked. She knew that asking would make her happy, and apparently she was so unused to that sensation that she would tumble into it over and over again, like a humourless pratfall.

Sax’s eyes lifted from his computer screen, sharpening. “These albedo maps are rich with information,” he said. “Nothing at all like our model predicted.” A minute pause while to check whether she was truly interested. She leaned forward, and he tilted the screen to show her. “This talus field is, we believe, the most Mars-like. We’ll use it for an index.”

“What’s the mineral composition?”

He told her, and they tinkered with a few model parameters. Sax soaked up her opinions and deferred to expertise without the slightest ego. Intellectually generous. A good scientist. Beside her she could feel the morning warmth of his body through the ratty thermal wear that was the indoor uniform in Antarctica. There was spray of wrinkles at the corner of his eye, unique as a thumbprint.

“We should hike up and see the talus ourselves,” she said. She said it fast, deliberately tricking herself so she could get it out before she felt its significance. A deep breath and then, too aggressively: "Let’s go on a hike.”

The retreat was instant and total. His face became as distant as a statue. She knew from the heated sensation that her own face had turned a particularly ugly red colour. One more bad thing that happened on Earth. Put it in a box with the rest, leave it behind, all of it, you’ll be on another planet and it won’t matter. But Sax would be on Mars too, impossible to escape.

Focus on how lucky she’d been this time. Sax was so insensible to the little eddies of the stations gossip. Ann might disgust him, but he wouldn’t expose her to the circling jackals. She needed to remember that she was lucky.

With his eyes fixed on the data transformation that he was still doing on his computer screen, Sax said in a remote voice, “Karen.” It was the name of the woman from the selection committee whose bedroom was a few metres away down the hall. Ann was at a loss. Was Sax interested in a committee member? It seemed like an uncharacteristically stupid way for him to torpedo his chances.

Oh. Oh. People who were used to conducting love affairs—people who were not Ann, obviously—had techniques for doing it under the radar, for avoiding a splashy blowout like that Russian couple had caused. Sax was telling her yes, he was just saying he wanted to be discreet.

Ann’s heart began to pound. Fight or flight.

“I’ll take my breakfast and start walking now,” she said, thinking as she talked. “There are some lovely pegmatites up at Lookout Point. I might take some samples. Wander around a few hours.”

“I should finish this analysis while my ideas are fresh,” Sax said. “In a few hours I’ll probably want to stretch my legs.”

“Good. That’s good.” He still hadn’t made eye contact, still tapped at his keyboard. “Thanks for the coffee Sax.”

“You’re w-welcome,” he stammered.

An assignation, Ann thought in her room, throwing on her warm clothes. It was only ten below zero outside the station, but the windchill on Lookout Point would be intense. She had an assignation. “Holy hell,” she said aloud, a phrase that she remembered her father using in his good moods. How terrified she’d been, as a little girl, whenever he smiled that way.

No. Put that in the box and close the lid on it. She was on another planet, somehow, this couldn’t possibly still be Earth. These things didn’t happen to her.

Unless she’d misunderstood everything and Sax really had been talking about stretching his legs.

The misunderstanding seemed more and more likely as Ann puttered around the ridge below Lookout Point. She resisted looking at her watch. The pegmatites were indeed beautiful, some feldspar crystals walnut-sized or bigger. She had her hammer with her, but she didn’t collect any samples. It was enough to see them in the place where they’d formed.

Thankfully, she got absorbed in what she was doing, so much that she didn’t even pause to tuck her hair back under her cap when the wind loosened it. She missed hearing Sax’s hail until he was only a few metres away. She turned, strands of hair plastering over her eyes and mouth, and saw his cheeks pink from the wind. That’s when she noticed she was already smiling.

They hiked the last distance together. It was a cloudless day, like every day in the Dry Valleys. You could see the northern part of McMurdo from here, the biggest station on Antarctica, a sprawling village almost, but like no other village on Earth. Squint, and you could be already on Mars. The lookout point itself had a small weather station consisting of an antenna, a whirring anemometer, and a plywood chest for maintenance equipment, which people usually used as a bench.

They sat. The wind was flowing up from the stony valley, washing Ann’s face like cool water. They were already deep in conversation. When she was away from Sax and tying herself in knots of anxiety, she forgot how easy this part was. The words just flowed when she was with him.

“Giving Mars a biosphere increases its, its organizational complexity,” he was saying, but his frown told her that he wasn’t just hammering on a fixed opinion. He was thinking this through with her, even though the whole direction of his thoughts was nonsense. “That increase in net order, that’s the point of science.”

“No, no.” She started to laugh. “How can you say that? The point of science is to know. Destroying a planet is antithetical to science!”

He frowned again, and she reached out to grasp his shoulder. But somewhere in the centimetres between them the gesture went wrong. It seemed planned and awkward, although it hadn’t been; it had been a pure impulse, because he was listening to her, because he cared about what she cared about. But as her hand landed on his shoulder, Sax jumped.

It had been a misunderstanding after all. This wasn’t his thing. Or she wasn’t, who knew. Poor, malfunctioning, too-tall flesh. Ann yanked the hand back and kneaded it against her thigh. The fingertips were going numb, damage from last winter’s frostbite; and she knew her brain well enough to know that the emotional numbness would also be worse because of her pre-existing damage. She was a walking disaster. It was for the best that Sax wasn’t interested, probably.

Sax kept blinking and frowning. His attention, which up until this moment had made her thrum with happiness, now seemed to flay her raw. It didn’t stop. He was too close. He was leaning in.

He was kissing her. Both of them were wearing their gloves. There were only a few places where bare skin was touching, lips, nose and cheekbones, so chilled that at first it didn’t feel like skin at all. And then everything was warm, warm, warm.

The walk back was quiet. A little chillier, since the sun had rolled around the horizon and disappeared behind the Olympus Range. They didn’t start talking about Mars again, though Ann was thinking about it. What did it mean that she was still imagining conversations with him, even when he was right beside her? More wires crossed in her brain no doubt, probably because the things that Mars and Sax made her feel, the upwelling of promise and apprehension, were so nearly identical that it could not fail to set off a deep warning, in that place she had sealed away. To love something and to destroy it are so close, or at least they were for her. An abused child’s conviction that fairness wouldn’t apply, that the laws of the universe were different for her and never to her benefit.

“There’s your talus,” he said, pointing, and took his pyranometer from his pocket so he could measure the solar radiation. “These are g-granitic?”—peering up at her to check he’d gotten it right. Her stammer. Her Sax.

He had listened to her, but he hadn’t changed his mind. But he will, she thought. Once we’re really there, once we’re standing on a new world, he has to.

Heels hitting the floor, my mother puts a metal comb through my hair. The teeth of the comb sometimes collide with my scalp, making me cringe at the feeling. My cringing doesn't distract her though, she is completely focused on my hair. A few minutes pass as she finally stops combing my hair and passes me a small compact mirror. I take a peek at my reflection but that's all. Mother looks at me with her eyebrows furrowed.

"Relax honey. Trust me, you have nothing to worry about. I think we both know which faction you're likely to get." A bright smile beams from my mother's face when she says that. Truth is, she isn't wrong. She and I both know that I am likely to get the faction of my origin, Erudite. I don't know if I'm supposed to be happy with that or not. I answer her with "I know. Sorry." All she does is nod her head. "I'll get my car ready to take you to school."

***

I hop into the car and wave to mother and then she sets the autopilot for the school. I bite the inside of my lip. No matter what she has said to me this morning, I'm still feeling anxious. The rules state that we are not allowed to prepare for the test in any way. My thoughts come to a halt as the autopilot puts on the breaks. I open the door and get out of the car and it starts driving away, back to Erudite Headquarters.

I make my way over to my faction and wait to be let inside the building. We have to stand beside our factions and we are not allowed to mix with others until later on in the day. It's the same every time we go to school.

My faction falls into complete silence. Being slightly puzzled, I look around. To the left of us, members of Abnegation start lining up with there heads looking down on to the floor. The Erudite and the Abnegation have never really got along. Abnegation people think us Erudite are self-indulgent and Erudite think Abnegation are selfish. It is pretty much a constant battle between the two factions.

Soon enough, the loud and obnoxious Dauntless arrive and we make our way into the school building.

***

An Erudite teacher gives the usual speech for aptitude testing. Well, at least from what I have read it is similar to the original speech. The teacher calls out names for two people from every faction to take them to the testing rooms.

"Jen Matthews," She says, loud and clear. I inhale and exhale and make my way over to her and go into the testing room. Cautiously walking in, the door shuts behind me and automatically locks itself. After the fright from the door, I glance over the room. There is a chair in the middle with electrodes at either side of the headrest. An Abnegation woman stands at the computer, typing away and preparing some sort of chemical vial in a small glass. I take a seat on the chair and calm myself.

The woman from Abnegation finally talks "Hello. My names Natalie and I'll be administering your aptitude test today." She smiles after concluding her sentence to which I smile back, she seems nice. "You should expect to go through a series of simulations that will ultimately tell me what faction is best.." She pauses mid-sentence "Here, drink this." I take the glass from her hand the vial is a translucent blue. I sniff it, before forcing myself to drink it. My eyes feel drowsy within seconds and poof. The room I was in is gone and I'm left in darkness.

***

My eyes flutter open at their own pace and I wake in the testing room. Looking over to Natalie, I see a small grin, as she types at the computer again. As an Erudite, I am curious so I ask "What were my results?" She smiles sweetly once more, before getting me to stand. "Well, you have an aptitude for Erudite.. and Abnegation, Amity and Dauntless." Now Natalie looks more on edge, her creases in her forehead tell me so. I ask one more thing "So, you are saying I'm Divergent?" Natalie just nods yes.

He was born in winter.

...or at least that’s what it felt like, evverything else before this cold empty world felt like a dream had by somebody else. The days before the very end were like a nightmare you’d have before waking. He tried to tell his dad that and he said a lot of people felt that way... but he didn’t think he understood completely and Johnny wasn’t sure how to explain

He looked at the steely gray sky in wonder, fat snowflakes falling, scarf fluttering in the cold wind.

“Johnny!” He heard his father call out in panic from the ground. Momentarily distracted he came plummeting down into the his arms.

“I told you not to do that, at least not so damn high.”

“Nuh yuk soo.” He insisted, as he thought at him: ‘The view is better up there, the snow-’

“Oh, I’m sure. It’s also better to get yourself hurt.” He said a he let him down.

‘Ung-uh...” ‘I wasn’t going to get hurt, and you’re the one who broke my concentration.

“Sure, you’re just lucky I was able to catch you.” His father said, looking uneasily down the street of the empty town as they crossed it. Even he was different, bearded a shabby, like the him in the before times were just part of a beautiful  dream. With baseball and friends, his Mom and the house, the one they'd shared with his Dad before left to live in an apartment for reasons he didn't understand. He faintly remembered him saying he might when he got older.

He remember hoping in the dream he’d come back. Now he wondered if any of it was real.

“Is everything alright?” His father asked, and he nodded, taking the man’s hand. He knew at the very least he was real even if he wasn't quite how he remembered him. He knew his Mom was real, based on the look of sorrow his Dad got when he asked about her and told him she didn’t survive the fight like they did.

“Ugula brah?” Johnny vocalised, asking: ‘I’m not thinking out loud again am I?’

“No no, you just have a look on your face.” His father smiled as he said that. He didn’t smile as much as the man in the dream unfortunately, as if the great fight he spoke of stole that too. But he’d do it despite that, usually at him or Tom.

He didn’t remember Tom from before, his father said that was because he met him when he was in Boston getting his book deal, when everything went down. He liked Tom, he cooked and he knew how to do all sorts of fun things, plus was more excitable then his father despite carrying a similar tiredness as him, like matching scars. When he first met him he thought he was was a lot older then his Dad, but it turned out it was only by a little over five years.

‘You probably think that because he’s balding, some men aren’t as lucky and start to lose their hair by their thirties.’

Tom, who been in the other room started laughing at when he said that. ‘I heard that, you better watch your mouth!’

His father grinned mischievously at that. Yes, he certain liked Tom.

”peep Ungh-la?” 'Can we see Oola?'

“Tom’s probably back at the house now and waiting for us.” 

“Ugh bah-wah!" 'But it’s on the way!'

“She’s all right, by some small miracle Oola knows how to take care of herself, and she’s damn good at it too.” 

“Unga flaf!” he spat out, protesting: 'We wont have to be long!'

His father sighed. “We’ll just stop by, alright kiddo?”

---

Trust Johnny to make a simple scourging trip eventful, he'd dipped into somewhere for a couple minutes and the kid was in the air.

He suppose he should've known things wouldn't get back to how they were... nothing would ever be how it was before, how was this any different? But still, he didn't imagine this. That Johnny would could be brought back from whatever abyss he'd been sent to, and yet still retain the characteristics of phoners. Characteristics he would probably always be affected by fact and Clay had to accept that.

It had been a little over three weeks but Clay was already getting used to the phoner babble Johnny had acquired after they taken the gamble of giving him another earful of whatever was left of the phoner virus. When he started talking again it was telepathic, projected in whoever's head he was talking to, coupled with that border line nonsensical talk he was all too familiar with, something that Clay was sure neuroscientists would come to the conclusion it had to do with a damaged speech center in the brain. Well, maybe they'd see it that way, comparing it to brain damage victims, because that would've been all they could compare it to.

But they weren't here, as far as they knew. So they couldn't, they had to come to their own conclusions. 

And of course it wasn't just phoner babble, aside from talking in people's minds he could also read them if you weren't too careful with your thoughts, and the self levitation. Perhaps that telekinesis extended to other things, time could only tell. 

He didn’t like to admit it but it had freaked him out at first, and he knew a lot of the survivors would probably feel the same.

‘Hey, he’s still your kid, you saw that, how he was looking at you right? How he was speaking to you?” Tom said after he’d followed him when he went outside to collect himself, leaning against the house. It was raining at the time and they were under an overhang.

“I know, I was hoping... it would be different, I don't know why but I hoped things would go back to how they were before.” He shook his head. “God damn I feel like a bad father, heaven knows I'm lucky things ended up.”

“You went out to find him despite every indication that he should’ve been gone. I’ll bet your stubborn ass would’ve kept looking forever if it was necessary.”

“But this is different. This is me being a whiny bitch."

Tom scoffed a little, leaning against the building so they were shoulder to shoulder. "You know, my mother and I didn't exactly get along with very well, but she did give me a bit of very good advice: You're allowed to have nasty thoughts and feelings, but you just have to deal with them in a way that doesn't hurt people. I'd say stepping out for a bit is a decent way of dealing."

"Right, sure..." He said with tired dismissive smile. 

"That was when I was a kid of course, she didn't exactly keep her own advice when I came out after college."

Clay burst into laughter at that, before tusking in dismay at himself for doing that, taking Tom's hand,kissing the knuckles sympathetically. "Geez, that's fucking dreadful Tom..." he muttered against them, gazing into his eyes

"Long past... long gone." Tom held his gaze, smiling kindly at him, reaching up to touch his distraught face. “We’re gonna get through this. We haven’t let those bastards best us yet.”

“What about the others?”

“He’s your fucking kid. We’re gonna hunker down for winter, and then we’ll go home... and they’ll love him alright?”

Trust Tom not to take any shit, but in a nice way.

He was getting used to the nonsense babble. What he wasn't prepared for was the loneliness it had created for Johnny, almost an otherness, and from that the longing to find someone like them that shared that otherness. And for Johnny that meant a nack for finding stray phoners.

Most of those attempts were disappointing, for one they learned they had in fact gotten lucky with Johnny, at his insists they tried 'reprograming' a few like they had with him. Most they didn't improve, or in the last case they made it worse.

Johnny didn't them to try  anymore after that.

But then they found Oola, who they didn't even need to offer any assistance. She was of her own person, in a matter of speaking

Clay didn't know who'd she'd been before, but Clay assumed she'd been a housewife of some sort, around Sharron's age specifically. Which Clay imagined was particularly relevant to how quickly Johnny had gotten attached to her. Sure she didn't look like Shannon specifically, being fifteen to twenty pounds heavier with flaming red hair tied back in a bun that was more like a loose permanent nest of tangles.

But regardless appearance differences, in a previous life he imagined she was very motherly. The kind who made lunches before school, helped them with school projects, maybe had a mini van depending how many she had.

Now she'd been reduced to looking like most other phoners, including their habits. For instance when they first encountered her she'd been eating a deer in the middle of what he imagined used to be a picturesque street.

"Rast!" she'd hissed at them, blood down the front of her housecoat. He wasn't sure which scenario was worse: if she's found the thing dead already or killed it herself.

'Maybe it was on it's last legs?'  Johnny offered when he remarked on it later on. He suppose he should've known how Johnny would be about this by that, but how could he have guessed?

Johnny ran ahead when they got close to the garage where Oola stayed.

"Hey, wait for me champ!" Clay called ahead, but the kid didn't listen. Despite him hurrying ahead he took a moment, looking down the road, where the snow was starting to collect  on the black asphalt and just wanting to go home. Well, not home precisely, he wasn't quite sure it they could consider it that yet missing their friend's something fierce, but it was where Tom was waiting and that was good enough. Good enough to brave out the winter anyway.

He soldiered forward where Johnny had disappeared into the backyard to look for Oola. When Clay got there there he was faced with a greenhouse that was roughly the size of a medium sized shed, Oola's greenhouse. He could see Johnny greeting Oola, her reaction excited, crowing in phoner nonsense as they hugged. Despite his apprehension, Clay smiled at the exchange, know how much it meant to Johnny.

When Clay stepped in the doorway Oola, dressed in a different housecoat then he remembered her wearing last time to his surprise, stepped in front of Johnny and bellowed out: 'g'nast! Nast!'

'She said...'

"I could hear what she said too." Clay said flatly. It had been 'Astard! turd!'

She babbled as she puttered around the green house, cluttered with figurines she'd must've found places that reminded him of those candle lit catholic shrines. Everything from garden gnomes to precious moments characters to baby dolls.

"Amble somble." Johnny said with a little shrug as he picked up a little jointed ceramic teddybear. 'Sorry, she says she doesn't want you in here still.'

"Still doesn't trust me huh?" Clay said. "You told here I'm your dad right?"

'Don't think it helped much.'

"Well I won't come in then, I'll just sit out here and wait. But remember-"

'I know, we need to go soon'

"I don't want Tom to worry." Clay insisted.

After a drawn out goodbye, one where Oola pressed the teddy bear figurine he'd been looking at in his hands insistently, him and Johnny continued on thier way home.

He smelled it before he came inside, some type of stew Tom had started before they'd left.

Tom's face lit up  when they came into the kitchen lit by a couple of kerosene lamps and what was left of the light outside. "Everything go well?"

"Fantastic, we found some more fuel for the lamps." He said, lifting the basket he carried before setting it on the ground before moving to embrace Tom and kiss him.

"Blyuck..." Johnny said as he passed them to go to his room. Clay could feel Tom smile in amusement before breaking away, still holding him though.

"That he has no trouble vocalizing." He said with mild annoyance.

"Course he can, he's a kid." Tom insisted, before looking at him with concern. "Everything alright?"

"Dandy." They pulled apart, Clay glancing around for something to before starting to putting away the clean dishes, taking care to put asides three bowls and cutlery for the stew. "We visited Oola today. Well... Johnny did anyway. I was just there."

Tom grinned. "She still hates you doesn't she?"

"Hate is a strong word, but yes, with a burning passion.: He said quietly. "...I still don't get it, what did I do?"

"I don't know, she seems to like me alright." Tom boasted 

"She tolerates you." Clay corrected. "Only because you bring cake."

"It was cornbread, and that was once."

"Well you make some pretty damn good corn bread." Clay said, hugging him from behind and kissing the back of his neck.

Tom giggled in a way he could imagine he was turning red, playfully elbowing Clay away. "Stop that, I'm busy..."

"Rain check?" Clay stepped away, taking the time to remove his coat.

"Rain check." Tom opened the baking portion of the stove and pulled out the corn bread. They had it fairly often but it certainly was good.

"The wood cooking seems to give a different quality to it." He commented when they sat down to eat shortly after. "A good quality I mean."

"But is it worth it?"

"Could be worse, stove's nice, we found all that wood, plus it heats things up nicely."

As Johnny ate, staring at the snow falling in piles now, he looked up at them and asked: 'Do you think Oola's cold? It can't be very warm in her greenhouse at night, and I don't know if she has a coat...'

"We've seen her in the garage next to the greenhouse, she can go in there." Tom insisted.

'What if she forgets she can?' 

"Oola is a tough cookie, if she can change her housecoat she'll have the sense to seek cover." 

Tom choked on his food a bit. "She did what now?"

"You know that grubby sky blue thing with the daisies she was wearing? She's in a red gingham one now." Clay answered.

'She still get's confused though, she keeps calling me Billy. That's not close to Johnny at all.'

"Getting names wrong is minor, she's a miracle as it is, I'm sure she knows to seek shelter when she needs to." Tom said gently.

'But can we check on her tomorrow, just in case?'

"We can, sure. We can all go." Tom looked expectantly at Clay.

"Of course." Clay agreed.

---

"I don't know how you do it, but you're so much better at wording things. Especially when it comes to the phoner topic, makes me feel like such an asshole in comparison."

They were getting ready for bed and Tom gave him a look over his shoulder. "I can't tell if that's a compliment or an accusation."

He was sitting on the end of the bed, and smiled back at him apologetically as he pulled on a fresh pair of socks. "It's me being insecure, and wondering how the hell your doing it better then me."

"I don't know, maybe it's because I don't have a horse in this race, maybe you're feeling more pressure then me."

"...Maybe." Clay grumbled as Tom sat next to him, arms curling around his. "I'm still adjusting really."

"I gotta say I've never known the kid as anything else, I have the privilege of not having to adjust from however things used to be."

"How things used to be... Johnny calls it 'the dream'. Like something he woke up from... that's hard to shake. Like everything before never happened."

"But aren't you proof that it wasn't?"

Clay turned to face him, smiling a bit. "Decent point as any."

"Damn straight it is..." Tom insisted back and they kissed, the snow blowing outside in a way that he dreaded braving tomorrow but made him glad to be inside with Tom for now, and he slid an arm around him

"How about that rain check?" He murmured, kissing down his neck, and Tom chuckled.

"...Thought you'd never ask."

It was surprising how quickly he'd gotten used to this too, how he'd grown to yearn for the other man, for the time they'd spent alone at the end of the day where he didn't have to think about what the uncertain future held ahead. Maybe it was because he felt so comfortable with Tom, partially because he never felt pressured to go anywhere he didn't want to. 'the heavier stuff' one might say

"It's what anyone would do." Tom replied when he'd commented on it after they'd fooled around, curled up together under the covers. 

'I don't think that's all that true... but just mean not asking, I mean I don't feel pressured."

"Well maybe I don't care about that fucking shit." Tom said, voice scorning the very idea. '"It's overrated, besides... why shouldn't getting off with you like this be enough? Seeing you comfortable and happy?"

That was something to think about. '"I don't know how any of this shit works" he said, to which Tom scoffed at.

"And you think I, the man whose spent the past twenty some years focusing on my career and being terrified of AIDS have any better of an idea then you?"

Clay couldn't help but grin at that, rolling partially on top of him, pressing his lips to his. "Right, your career, I remember you in your tweed suit... bet you were such a nerd before all of this."

"You know you liked that suit... besides, I hardly think the comic book artist has room to talk." Tom retorted tiredly.

"Graphic novel artist." He insisted before growing serious again, resting his head on Tom's shoulder. "I'm sorry about that... AIDS is some fucking scary bullshit." I'm glad you're still here. He wanted to add, but that felt too sentimental, to close to something he was still trying to come terms with. 

Tom stroked lazy circles on his back, saying: "You're telling me," before they fell asleep together in their warm cocoon of blankets.

 The Doctor raced into the TARDIS, Martha hot on his heels. "Get down!" the Doctor yelled and both he and Martha hit the deck as a green bolt of energy whizzed overhead. The Doctor slammed the door shut and raced over to the console. "Did they see you?" he asked Martha urgently.

"I don't know." she replied

"Did they see you?"

"I don't know, I was too busy running!"

"Martha, it's important... Did they see your face?"

"No, they couldn't have."

The Doctor then ran around the console and started working the controls. "Off we go!" he said and Martha joined him as they watched the time rotor intently. Suddenly, the monitor began to beep in warning. "Ahh, they're following us!" the Doctor groaned

"But how can they do that? You've got a time machine." Martha pointed out

"Stolen technology, they've got a Time Agent's Vortex Manipulator." the Doctor told her, "They can follow us wherever we go, right across the universe... they're never gonna stop." He ran a hand through his hair, racking his brains for a solution to their current predicament. "Unless... I'll have to do it." He turned to Martha and looked right into her eyes. "Martha, you trust me, don't you?"

"Of course I do." Martha replied

"Cos' it all depends on you." the Doctor said, reaching under the console for something.

"What does? What am I suppose to do?" Martha asked

The Doctor produced an ornate fob watch with Galifreyean symbols engraved in it. "Take this watch." he said, handing the watch to Martha, "Cos' my life depends on it. The watch, Martha, this watch is..."

~8~

John Smith jerked awake in his bed. He shook his head, dismissing the dream he'd just had and got out of bed. There was a knock at the door. "Come in." he called and Martha entered, wearing a 1910's maid's uniform and carrying a breakfast tray.

"Pardon me, Mr Smith." she said when she saw him in his pyjamas, "I can come back later."

"No, it's alright, it's alright." John waved her off, putting on his dressing gown, "Put it down." Martha complied, John watching her thoughtfully. "I was, um.. Sorry, sorry. Sometimes I have these extraordinary dreams."

"What about, sir?" Martha asked, opening the curtains.

"I dream I'm this... adventurer. This... daredevil, a madman. 'The Doctor', I'm called. And last night, I dreamt that you were there. As my... companion."

"A teacher and a housemaid, sir?" Martha asked rhetorically, "That's impossible."

"And I'm a man from another world." John continued

"That can't be true, because there's no such thing."

John went over to the mantle and picked up the fob watch with the Galifreyean symbols. "This thing. The watch, it was.." he murmured, considering it for a moment, then put it down again. "Yeah, it's funny how dreams slip away. But I do remember one thing, it all took place in the future. In the year of Our Lord 2008."

"I can prove that wrong for you, sir." Martha smiled, "Here's the morning paper." She picked a newspaper up off the tray and handed it to him. "It's Monday, November 10th 1913, and you're completely Human, sir. As Human as they come." she finished, with a slight undercurrent of disappointment in her voice.

John didn't notice it "Hmm, that's me." he said brightly, "Completely Human."

~8~

The Union Flag was raised to full mast as boys sang a hymn, ready to begin the day at Farringdon Boy's School. John watched as a group of boys marched smartly past, like a platoon of soldiers. "Morning, sir." one of them greeted as they passed him.

John made his way inside the building, ready to start his lessons for the day. By the stairs, he passed Mr Rocastle the headmaster, a stern, pompous ex-military man. "Headmaster." John greeted.

~8~

John was soon busy teaching a class about the Napoleonic wars. "Impediment. The French were all but spent, with only two battalions of the old guard remaining." he informed his pupils, "A final reserve force was charged with protecting Napoleon. By evening, the advance of the Allied troops had forced them to retreat."

~8~

Presently, Martha was scrubbing the floor in the main hallway with another maid, Jenny. Martha and the Doctor had been at the school for two months now. The Doctor had made himself Human and believed he was a school teacher named John Smith while Martha was his personal maid. The past two months had been unbearable for Martha. Jenny and the school matron were nice to her, but everyone else looked down their noses at her due to her skin colour. "Morning, sir." she greeted as John walked past on his way to his next class.

"Yes, quite." John nodded, before moving off upstairs.

"Head in the clouds, that one." Jenny commented, "Don't why you're so sweet on him."

"He's just kind to me, that's all." Martha replied, "Not everyone's that considerate, what with me being..." She gestured to herself.

"A Londoner?" Jenny laughed

"Exactly! Good old London town!" Martha grinned

Just then, two senior boys, Jeremy Baines and Thomas Hutchinson, walked by. "Uh, now then, you two. You're not paid to have fun, are you?" Baines said snobbishly, "Put a little backbone into it."

"Yes sir, sorry sir." Jenny said sheepishly and went back to work.

"You there, what's your name again?" Hutchinson asked Martha

"Martha, sir. Martha Jones."

"Tell me then, Jones. With hands like those, how can you tell when something's clean?" Hutchinson said and he and Baines laughed cruelly at their joke.

Smack!

A feminine hand appeared out of nowhere and gave Hutchinson a good clip round the ear. "I say!" he protested as he spun round, only to see the school matron, Iris Pangbourne, standing behind him with her hands on her hips and a stern expression on her face. "Oh, hello, Matron. I didn't see you there." Hutchinson blustered

"Clearly." Iris said dryly, "Now, I know you boys think you're God's gift to the world but just because you think you are, it doesn't mean you actually are, and it doesn't give you the right to forget your manners and talk down to other people. Now apologise to Miss Jones right now."

"Oh, Matron..." Hutchinson began to protest

"Hutchinson, I am giving you a choice." Iris told him, "Either you apologise or I tell Mr Smith what you just said to his maid. I'm sure he'll something to say to you."

Hutchinson knew that he would face severe punishment if John found out so he had no choice but to swallow his pride. "I apologise for my remarks, Miss Jones." he said begrudgingly.

"That's better." Iris nodded, "Now don't let me catch you saying such vile remarks again."

"Yes, ma'am." Hutchinson grunted and he and Baines went sulkily away.

Iris turned to Martha. "There you go, Martha. I don't think they'll be troubling you again." she said

"Yeah, thanks, Matron." Martha nodded

"Don't mention it." Iris smiled, "You two coming down the pub tonight?"

"We'll be there." Jenny grinned

"Good. See you both tonight." Iris nodded and went on her way upstairs.

~8~

John was just leaving his office with a pile of books when Iris came up behind him. "Morning, Mr Smith." she greeted

"Oh, there we go." John jumped, dropping a book.

"Oh, sorry, Mr Smith. Let me help you." Iris offered

"No, no, I've got it." John insisted, "Let me just... no. How to retrieve. Ah, could you take these?" He handed Iris the stack of books and bent down to pick up the book he'd dropped. "No harm done. So, um, how was Jenkins?"

"He's fine." Iris replied, "Just a cold, nothing serious. I think he's homesick more than anything."

"Oh, we can't have that." John said

"He received a letter from home this morning, so he's in better sprits now." Iris replied, "Um, what do you want done with these books?"

"Oh, sorry." John blustered, realising that he'd forgotten Iris was still holding them, "Just let me..." He rather awkwardly reached forward to take them off her.

"Tell you what, why don't we take half each?" Iris suggested

"Ah, brilliant idea. Brilliant." John agreed, taking half of the books, "Perfect division of labour."

"Teamwork." Iris smiled, "So, is there anywhere in particular we're taking these?"

"Yes, um, this way." John said, nodding down the hallway. Ever the gentlemen, he let Iris lead on. "I always say, Matron, give the boys a good head of steam, they'll soon wear themselves out."

"I hope you don't mind, but I'd rather you called me Nurse Pangbourne when it's just you and me." Iris said, "Matron makes me feel, well, old."

"Ah, sorry, Nurse Pangbourne." John nodded as they started to head downstairs, "If you forgive me for asking, but how old are you?"

"I turned 22 last month." Iris replied, "In fact, although I've only known you all of two months, I'd prefer it if you called me 'Iris'."

"Iris?"

"That's my name." she nodded

"Ah, pretty name." John observed. In fact, he thought that Iris was rather pretty herself, with her porcelain skin, stormy blue eyes, long auburn hair and hourglass figure.

"And your first name's John, isn't it?" Iris asked him

"Yes, yes it is."

They paused by a bulletin board halfway down the stairs. "Have you seen this, John?" Iris asked, gesturing to a flyer, "It's the annual dance at the village hall tomorrow night. It's nothing formal, just a nice bit of fun so I'm told. Do you think you'll go?"

John stammered for a moment, unsure how to answer. "I haven't thought about it." he blustered

"I haven't been to a dance in ages." Iris said, "Not since I was in school."

"Well, I should imagine that you would be..." John babbled, trying to think of what to say, "Um... I mean, I'm sure if you're up for... I mean... that is... I probably won't, but even if I did then I couldn't... um, I mean I wouldn't want to..."

"The stairs." Iris said suddenly

"What about the stairs?" John asked

"They're right behind you." Iris warned. While John had been babbling, he'd been unknowingly walking backwards towards the stairs.

John turned to see, lost his balance and tumbled down the stairs. Iris could only grimace, the she rushed down to help him.

~8~

Iris had soon helped John back to his room and was tending to his sore head. John was grunting and grumbling dreadfully. "You know, I get boys making less fuss than you're making." Iris commented

"Because it hurts." John moaned

Just then, Martha burst in. "Is he alright?" she asked worriedly

"Martha, how many times do I have to tell you? Knock before entering." John reprimanded

"Leave her alone, she's just worried about you." Iris countered

"But is he alright?" Martha persisted then looked at John. "They said you fell down the stairs, sir."

"No, it's just a tumble, that's all." John waved her off

"Have you checked for concussion?" Martha asked Iris, her medical background instinctively kicking in.

"First thing I did." Iris reassured her, "He's going to be alright."

"Thank you, Matron." Martha nodded, "I'll just tidy up." She moved to the desk and began tidying it up.

"I was just telling Nurse Pangbourne... Matron, um, about my dreams." John said, moving to the settee, "They are quite remarkable tales." He turned to Iris. "I keep imagining that I'm someone else, and that I'm hiding."

"Oh, really? Hiding in what way?" Iris asked in interest

"They're almost every night." John replied, "This is going to sound silly..." he laughed

"Oh, don't shy." Iris smiled, "There's nothing wrong with a bit of silly."

"I dream, quite often, that I have two hearts." John told her

"Well, I can soon settle that." Iris smiled, pulling her stethoscope out of her bag and placing it on John's chest. "My diagnosis, just one heart, singular."

Martha looked disappointed but neither John or Iris noticed this and they both shared a laugh at the thought of someone having two hearts. "I have written down some of these dreams in the form of fiction." John continued, "Um, not that it would be of any interest."

"Oh, I'd be very interested." Iris reassured him

"Well... I've never shown it to anyone before." John said, going to his desk and retrieving a leather-bound journal which he handed to Iris.

"'Journal of Impossible Things.'" Iris read the handwritten title on the first page. She then turned the pages to see writing and sketched of various things. One showed a very sophisticated control console of some kind while another showed a small cylindrical device with a light on the end. "Very creative." Iris remarked, then she noticed sketches of all sorts of strange creatures. One depicted a child wearing a strange mask, while another depicted an object that resembled a dustbin. "Fascinating creatures." Iris observed

"Mmm, it's become quite a hobby." John remarked

Iris flipped to the next page where she saw sketches of a squat toad-like creature, shop window dummies and a figure in 18th century French dress wearing a mask, then she noticed a sketch of a young woman. "And an eye for the ladies." Iris remarked good-naturedly.

"Oh, no, no, she's just an invention." John said, "This character, Rose, I call her, Rose. Seems to disappear later on."

On the next page, Iris saw a sketch of Martha, only she was wearing strange clothes. "Oh, there's you, Martha." Iris observed, then she saw sketched of figures in metal armour and a police public call box.

"Ah, that's the box, the blue box. It's always there." John explained, "Like a... like a magic carpet, this funny little box that transports me to far away places."

"Like a vehicle?" Iris queried

"Mmm." John confirmed, then Iris turned the page to see faces of various men including John's. "I sometimes think how magical life would be if things like this were true." John said wistfully.

"Me too." Iris agreed

"It's just a dream." John shrugged and they continued to look through the journal.

~8~

Presently, the bell rang denoting next classes and Iris left John to resume her duties. She was halfway down the corridor when Martha came running up behind her. "Ma'am, that book..." Martha began

"I'll look after it, Martha, don't worry." Iris assured her, "Mr Smith said I could read it."

"But it's silly, that's all." Martha persisted, "Just stories."

"I like stories." Iris countered lightly then became serious. "Who is he, Martha?"

"I'm sorry?"

"He seems like he's left kettle on. Like... he knows he has something important that he needs to tend to but can't remember what."

Martha laughed nervously. "That's just him."

"You came with him, didn't you?" Iris asked, "He found you this job at the school, correct?"

"I used to work for the family, he just sort of inherited me." Martha replied

"Hmm, well, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, Martha, but you need to be careful." Iris told her, "I've noticed how familiar you are with him and although I don't see any problem with that, other people here may not be so understanding. There's a lot of bigotry here at this school, as you saw with Hutchinson this morning and I don't want anything bad to happen to you."

"Yes, ma'am, thank you." Martha nodded, glad that Iris understood and accepted her as a person unlike the majority of people at the school.

"Don't mention it." Iris smiled and the two women went their separate ways.

~8~

That evening, Iris was heading for the pub where she'd planned to meet Martha and Jenny for a drink. As she was taking a shortcut across a field, she suddenly saw a bright green light appear a few metres above her in the sky and hover. Then, a green beam shone down on her for a few seconds before going out, leaving the young matron staring in disbelief at what she'd just seen. As she turned to look the way she'd come, she saw the green beam light up again and start to drift across the countryside before going out again. Spooked by it all, Iris turned and ran, not stopping until she reached the pub where Martha and Jenny were waiting.

"Matron, are you alright?" Martha asked, seeing how spooked Iris looked.

"I just saw something." Iris panted, "In the woods just now, this... light..."

At that moment, John came out of the pub. "Anything wrong, ladies?" he asked, "Far too cold to be standing around in the dark, don't you..."

"There it is again!" Iris interrupted, pointing to the sky where the green light flew overhead, "Look!"

"Oh, that's beautiful." Jenny breathed

"All gone." John said, "Commonly known as a meteorite. It's just rocks falling to the ground, that's all."

"I saw it coming down in the woods." Iris commented

"No, no, no, they always look close." John reassured her, "But actually they're miles off. Nothing left but a cinder. Now, I should escort you back to the school." He turned to Martha and Jenny. "Ladies?"

"No, we're fine thanks." Martha waved him off, staring at the sky.

"Then I shall bid you goodnight." John nodded, putting his hat on.

"See you both tomorrow." Iris called to her friends and she and John headed off back towards the school.

"Are you alright?" John asked once they were out of earshot of the others.

"Yes, I'm fine." Iris replied, "That light gave me a start that's all. I was reading your journal before leaving and I guess it made me jumpy."

"Well, everything's fine." John smiled, "There's nothing here that can harm us."

~8~

Next day, John was in his study when there was a knock at the door. He answered the door to find Timothy Latimer, a quiet, shy, but secretly brilliant boy, waiting outside. "You told me to come and collect that book, sir." Latimer said

"Good lad, yes, yes." John said, "The Definitive Account of Mafeking by Aitchison Price. Now, where did I put it?" He began rifling through the books on his desk. "And I wanted a little word. Your marks aren't quite good enough."

"I'm top ten in my class, sir."

"Now, be honest, Timothy." John said, "You should be the very top. You're a clever boy, you seem to be hiding it. Where is that book?" he grumbled, finding no sign of it on the desk. "And I know why." he continued, moving to his anteroom to check the bookcases, "Keeping your head low avoids the mockery of your classmates. But no man should hide himself, don't you think?"

"Yes, sir." Latimer replied from the other room.

"If you're clever, be proud of it, use it!" John encouraged. He rifled through several shelves then found the book he was looking for. "Fascinating details about the siege." he said as he returned to Latimer, "Really quite fascinating. Are you alright?" he asked, noticing that Latimer seemed rattled about something.

"Yes, sir. Fine, sir." Latimer replied hastily

"Right then, good." John nodded, giving him the book, "And remember, use that brain of yours." Latimer seemed to freeze over for a moment. "You're really not yourself, old chap." John frowned, "Anything bothering you?"

"No, sir, Thank you, sir." Latimer shook himself out of his daze and left the room.

~8~

Later that morning, John was teaching a class on the use of machine guns. Hutchinson was currently manning the gun while Latimer was in charge of ammunition. "Concentrate." John ordered.

Iris stepped out onto the school patio to watch. She felt rather sick at the sight. Although she found that John was a breath of fresh air compared to the other teachers at the school, it seemed that he still held their misguided belief in teaching the boys on how to kill.

"Hutchinson, excellent work." John praised as Hutchinson successfully hit his target.

Just then, Mr Rocastle came up. "Cease fire." he ordered

"Good day to you, headmaster." John greeted

"Your crew's on fine form today, Mr Smith." Mr Rocastle praised

"Excuse me, headmaster, we could do a lot better." Hutchinson spoke up, "Latimer's being deliberately shoddy."

"I'm trying my best." Latimer protested

"You need to be better than the best." Mr Rocastle told him, "Those targets are tribesmen, from the dark continent."

"That's exactly the problem, sir. They only have spears." Latimer pointed out

"Oh dear me, Latimer takes it upon himself to make us realise how wrong we all are." Mr Rocastle said haughtily, "I hope, Latimer, that one day you may have a just and proper war in which to prove yourself. Resume firing." he ordered and Hutchinson began firing again.

Suddenly, the gun stopped. "Stoppage. Immediate action." Hutchinson ordered Latimer, but Latimer didn't move. He was staring into space, completely shell-shocked at something. "Didn't I tell you, sir? The stupid boy's useless." Hutchinson sneered, "Permission to give Latimer a beating, sir?" he asked Mr Rocastle

"It's your class, Mr Smith." Mr Roscastle said to John

"Permission granted." John nodded

"Right, come with me, you little oik." Hutchinson growled and dragged the terrified Latimer away, most of the other boys accompanying them.

John then noticed that Baines was sniffing the air "Anything the matter, Baines?" he asked him.

"I thought... No, sir. Nothing, sir." Baines said and walked away

"As you were, Mr Smith." Mr Rocastle said, and went off back towards the school.

"Pemberton, Smyth, Wicks, take post." John ordered, and the boys took up positions. John then noticed Iris and walked over to her. "Ah, Nurse Pangbourne." he greeted cheerfully.

"Um, I'll give you your journal back next time I see you." Iris said stiffly

"No, no, no, you don't have to." John said, noticing a troubled expression on Iris' usually sunny features.

"If you'll excuse me, Mr Smith, I have to rescue Latimer." Iris said curtly and walked off, leaving John feeling a tad ashamed that he'd obviously incurred her disapproval.

~8~

That afternoon, John had no classes so he decided to head into the nearby village where he found Iris, who was running some errands. "Are you alright, Nurse Pangbourne?" John asked her, "You seemed a trifle bothered this morning."

"I found myself disappointed in you." Iris explained, "You authorised a beating even though you know nothing good ever comes from violence."

"I had no choice." John defended, "The headmaster would've questioned me if I'd refused Hutchinson permission."

"The headmaster is a fool." Iris replied, "I can't tell you how many times I've had to stop myself from telling him what he can do with his precious guns. There is nothing just and proper about war at all. My father served in the Army and he didn't think there was anything just and proper about killing. It seems to me that Latimer is the only person in this school to talk sense."

"How is he, anyway?" John asked

"He's fine." Iris replied, "I got there just in time."

"Good." John nodded, "Um, if you forgive me for asking, how did someone so young become matron?"

"Circumstances." Iris replied, "I came to the school two years ago as assistant nurse. Joan Redfern was matron then. Last April, she decided to visit America with her husband, sailing on the Titanic. They both survived the sinking, I'm relieved to say, but Nurse Redfern decided to retire after that experience and spend more time with her husband, hence I was promoted and here I am. I have to confess, there are times when I question my place here. When I decided to become a nurse, I did it because I wanted to help people, yet I find myself watching boys learning how to kill."

"Don't you think the discipline is good for them?" John asked

"Of course I think discipline is important." Iris replied, "But does it have to be military discipline? I mean, if there's another war, I don't think the boys will find it so amusing then."

"Well... Great Britain's at peace, long may it reign." John shrugged

"I read in your journal about next year, 1914."

"That was just a dream." John reassured her

"But all those images... of mud, trenches and barbed wire." Iris shivered, "You wrote of a dark shadow falling across the entire world."

"Well, then we can be thankful it's not true." John said, "I'll admit mankind doesn't need warfare and bloodshed to prove itself. Everyday life can provide honour and valour and... let's hope that from now on this, this country can... can find it's heroes in smaller places..." He became distracted as he noticed two things. First was a woman with a pram coming round the corner by a nearby shop. Second was two men lifting a piano to the upper floor of the shop. John saw that the rope on the piano was straining and about to break. The two men were trying their absolute best to hold it but the woman was walking obliviously towards the danger. "In the most..." John tailed off, seeing a boy playing with a cricket ball nearby. "Ordinary of..." He saw that the rope was on it's last strands, ready to break any second. "Of deeds." John finished, snatching the cricket ball from the boy. He threw it at a bundle of spare scaffolding pipes which hit a plank and catapulted a brick into the air. The brick hit a milk churn and knocked it over right in the woman's path, causing her to stop just as the rope gave way and the piano came crashing down, right where the woman would've walked had she not been stopped. "Lucky..." John murmured, surprised at himself for his own actions.

"That was not luck, that was amazing!" Iris breathed in admiration.

John plucked up courage. "Iris Pangbourne, might I invite you to the dance evening?" he offered, "As my guest?"

"Yes, you absolutely may!" Iris beamed, "It would be my honour, John Smith."

~8~

Presently, John and Iris were walking past a field with a scarecrow. "I think it's all becoming perfectly clear now." Iris said, "This 'Doctor' is the man you'd love to be, performing amazing feats with cricket balls."

"Well, I discovered a talent, that's certainly true." John shrugged

"And this Doctor's certainly quite the ladies' man." Iris said teasingly

"The devil!" John laughed

"He has girls in every fireplace." Iris continued

"Now there I have to protest." John smiled, "That's hardly me!"

"Oh, I dunno. You've asked me to the dance, you've got Martha as your personal servant." Iris continued good-naturedly.

"What do you think of Martha?" John asked her

"I think she's lovely." Iris replied, "She's not afraid to speak her mind and she cares about others. I wish there were more people like her."

John's eye was suddenly caught by something. "That scarecrow's all skewed." he frowned and went over to put the scarecrow right.

"An artistic eye as always." Iris observed, "Tell me, John, where did you learn to draw?"

"Galifrey." John replied absentmindedly then frowned, wondering why he'd said that.

"Where's that? Ireland?" Iris asked

"Yes, it must be, yes." John mumbled, a little unsure.

"Do you have any Irish ancestry?" Iris asked

"Not that I'm aware of." John replied, "My father Sydney was a watchmaker from Nottingham and my mother Verity was... um... well, she was a nurse, actually."

"Oh, there's a turn-up for the books." Iris smiled

"Well, my work is done. What do you think?" John asked, gesturing to the scarecrow.

"A masterpiece." Iris replied

"All sorts of skills today!" John laughed and they both resumed their journey. "Talking of parents, what about yours?" John asked Iris, "You said he served in the Army?"

"Yes, he served in the Royal Berkshire Regiment during the second Boer War." Iris replied, "Private Oliver Pangbourne. He fought at Spion Kop. When I was growing up, he told me about his experiences. They were what inspired me to become a nurse."

"And your mother?" John asked

"Her name's Katherine. She's a char lady for one of the big houses in Reading." Iris replied

"Ah, well, I think they should be proud of you." John complimented, "They have a wonderful daughter."

"Oh, stop it!" Iris laughed as they reached the road and headed off back towards the school.

Later that day, John had persuaded Iris to let him sketch her in his journal. "May I see it now?" Iris asked when John had finished. John sat beside her on the settee and showed her the sketch. "Goodness." Iris breathed, looking at the attractive young woman in the sketch, "Is that me? Can't be. Are you sure that's not me?" she laughed, pointing to a sketch of a hulking creature on the opposite page.

"Most definitely this page, I think." John reassured her, pointing to his sketch as her.

"Can't be." Iris persisted, "She's too beautiful to be me."

"You are beautiful, Iris." John told her earnestly, fondly brushing a stray strand of her hair behind her ear, "That's how I see you." He slowly leaned in towards her, she returned the movement, and they kissed briefly. "I've never, um..." John began when they broke apart, but ran out of words and chose to kiss Iris again, a long and loving kiss this time which she reciprocated. Suddenly, the door flew open and Martha appeared, causing John and Iris to quickly break apart. "Martha, what have I told you about entering unannounced?" John said irritably, annoyed at the interruption.

"John..." Iris scolded, but Martha had already scurried back out of the door and closed it behind her. Iris quickly got to her feet and headed after her but Martha had already disappeared down the corridor. "If you'll excuse me, John." she said to John, "I think I'd better get back to work. I'll see you tonight." And she left the room and headed off back towards the infirmary, butterflies in her stomach. This had been her first kiss and it was an amazing experience.

~8~

That evening, John was getting ready for the dance. He'd decided to wear a grey tweed suit and bowtie. "Robert De Niro's waiting, talking Italian." he sang to himself as he buttoned up his jacket and gave his reflection in the mirror the once over. "Robert De who?" he muttered as he realised what he'd been singing. He'd never heard of anyone called Robert De Niro, yet alone heard a song about someone with that name. "Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight." he sang again as he straightened his bowtie and smoothed out his hair. "No, maybe not." he muttered, wandering where he'd heard a song like that before. Just then, there was a knock at the door. "Come." John answered.

The door opened and Iris entered. John's eyes nearly popped out his head at the sight of her. She looked beautiful in a midnight blue velvet dress with satin lapels and cuffs, an off-white lace bodice and a midnight blue satin sash around her waist, while the skirt was of midnight blue satin with floral pattern embroidery at the hem. Her hair was worn half-up half-down, with the up part held in place by a jade butterfly comb while the down part cascaded down her back in fiery copper waves. Her shoes were royal blue suede pumps and she wore an off-white silk shawl with floral embroidery around her shoulders. "Is this acceptable?" she asked, doing a twirl to give John a full look.

"Perfect. You look wonderful." John smiled

A small blush appeared on Iris' cheeks. "I think you'd better warn me in advance, can you actually dance?" she asked

"Um, I'm not certain." John replied

"Oh, well, I guess this will be a learning curve for both of us." Iris smiled, "Is there anything you are certain about?"

"Yes." John replied, stepping closer to her, "Yes." And he kissed her tenderly and lovingly, Iris going along with it and reciprocating.

Suddenly, the door burst open and Martha flew in, looking as if she'd just been running for her life. "They've found us." she panted.

"Who have?" Iris questioned

"Martha, I've warned you..." John grumbled

"They've found us and I've seen them." Martha rambled frantically, "They look like people, like us, like normal. I'm sorry, but you've got to open the watch." She went over to the mantle to discover that the fob watch was nowhere to be seen. "Where is it? Oh, my God, where's it gone?" Martha fussed as she shuffled through things on the mantle, "Where's the watch?"

"What are you talking about?" John asked

"You had a watch, a fob watch. Right there." Martha told him, pointing to the empty spot where the watch had been.

"Did I?" John shrugged, "I don't remember."

"What's wrong, Martha?" Iris asked, puzzled at Martha's odd behaviour.

"We need it." Martha babbled, "Oh, my God, Doctor, we're hiding from aliens, and they've got Jenny and they've... possessed her or copied her or something and you've got to tell me, where's the watch?"

"Oh, I see." John said nonchalantly. "Cultural differences." he said quietly to Iris and picked up his journal. "It must be so confusing for you." he said to Martha in a patronising tone, "Martha, this is what we call a story."

"Oh, you complete..." Martha grumbled, realising that she was effectively talking to a brick wall. "This..." She waved a finger to indicate John. "...is not you. This is 1913."

"Good. This is 1913." John said casually, thinking he was right and Martha was just acting out.

"I am sorry, I'm really sorry but I've got to snap you out of this." Martha said and promptly slapped John across the face.

"Martha!" Iris gasped, shocked that Martha would lash out like that.

"Wake up!" Martha hollered at John, "You're coming back to the TARDIS with me!" And she grabbed his hands and tried to drag him along.

"How dare you!" John growled, yanking himself out of her grip, "I'm not going anywhere with an insane servant. Now get out!" And he forcefully shoved Martha out the door. "Nerve of it!" he grumbled, "You think I'm a fantasist, what about her?!" he said to Iris.

Iris snapped out of her shock. "She does have a point." she said, "There was a watch there yesterday, I'm sure of it. Anyway, let me have a look." She examined John's cheek. "Ah, good. Nothing broken. It'll just sting for a bit."

"Right then." John said, "Shall we?" He offered his arm and Iris took it.

~8~

John and Iris were soon arriving at the village hall. "Is everything alright?" John asked, noticing that Iris had been quiet on the way over from the school.

"I'm just worried about Martha." Iris replied, "She seemed such a lovely person. I wonder what would make her act like that. I know culture shock and that wasn't it."

"I'll talk to her in the morning." John reassured her, "Maybe she will have calmed down and we talk about it rationally. How's that?"

"Fine." Iris replied, giving him a smile.

"Spare a penny for the veterans of the Crimea, sir?" the doorman asked John, holding out a can.

"Yes, of course." John replied, reaching into his pocket, "There you are." He dropped two pennies into the can and he and Iris went inside.

People inside the hall were milling about, getting drinks from a beer keg, laughing and talking. "Ladies and gentlemen, please take your partners for a waltz." a man announced

John and Iris took their places and started to dance as the music started. "You can dance." Iris smiled

"Quite surprised myself." John laughed, only to accidentally bump into another couple. "Sorry." he called

"I guess we spoke too soon." Iris laughed.

~8~

Presently, John went to get some drinks while Iris sat down at one of the tables. The matron took a moment to survey the room. Most of the village had turned out to attend the dance. Her eyes fell on Latimer. She didn't know how he had gotten in as children were supposed to be accompanied by an adult but she decided to let it go as she felt that Latimer deserved to enjoy himself after the way Hutchinson treated him. Then she spotted another familiar face, Martha. "Martha, are you alright?" Iris asked, "I was worried about you."

Martha got to the point. "He's different from any other man you've ever met, right?"

"Yes."

"And sometimes he says these strange things, like people and places you've never heard of, yeah?" Martha continued, "But it's deeper than that. Sometimes when you look in the eyes, you know, you just know that there's something else in there. Something hidden. Right behind the eyes, something hidden away. In the dark."

"Martha, I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about." Iris said

"Yes, you do." Martha countered, "And I'm sorry, I really am, but the awful thing is it doesn't matter what you think. But you're nice and you're lucky. And I just want to say, I truly am very sorry for what I'm about to do."

Just then, John returned with the drinks. "Ah, Martha." he said sternly, "Perhaps now if you've calmed down, we can talk about..."

"D'you know what this is?" Martha interrupted, holding up the Doctor's sonic screwdriver, "Name it. Go on, name it."

"That's the magic wand from your journal." Iris realised, recognising the strange silver and blue cylindrical device as the same one she'd seen a sketch of.

John slowly took the sonic from Martha and turned it over in his hands, unable to believe that an item from his dreams was actually real. "You're not John Smith." Martha told him gently, "You're called the Doctor. That man in your journal, he's real. He's you."

But before John could answer, a portly man who John and Iris recognised as Mr Clark burst in carrying a strange-looking gun. He was followed by Baines, who had an arrogant smirk etched on his face. "You will be silent, all of you!" Clarke bellowed as Jenny came in, accompanied by what appeared to be walking scarecrows, exactly like the one John had fixed earlier that day.

"Mr Clarke! What's going on?" the announcer demanded. Mr Clarke responded by simply shooting the announcer with a green bolt of energy from his gun which completely vaporised him, causing panic and screaming from the terrified guests.

"No!" Iris breathed, horrified at what she'd just witnessed.

"Mr Smith, everything I just told you, just forget it!" Martha hollered to John, "Don't say anything."

"We asked for SILENCE!" Baines thundered, and the screams stopped. "Now then." Baines continued in a calm voice, "We have a few questions for Mr Smith."

"No, better than that." said a little girl with a red balloon, who Iris recognised as Lucy Cartwright, "The teacher, he's the Doctor. I heard 'em talking."

"You took Human form?" Baines questioned John

"Of course I'm Human. I was born Human!" John blustered, not understanding what was going on, "As were you, Baines. And Jenny, and you, Mr Clarke. What is going on? This is madness!"

"Oh, and a Human brain too." Baines commented, "Simple, thick and dull."

"But he's no good like this." Jenny said

"We need a Time Lord." Mr Clarke agreed

"Easily done." Baines smirked, pulling out a gun and aiming it at John, "Change back."

"I don't know what you're talking about." John protested

"Change back!" Baines demanded

"I literally do not know how..."

Jenny grabbed Martha and pointed a gun at her head. "She's your friend, isn't she?" Jenny grinned cruelly, "Doesn't this scare you enough to change back?"

"I don't you what you mean!" John insisted

"Wait a minute." Jenny pondered, "The maid told me about Smith and the matron... that women there!" She pointed at Iris.

"Then let's have you!" Clarke snarled, grabbing Iris and holding her hostage like Jenny did with Martha.

"Have you enjoyed it, Doctor?" Baines goaded John, "Being Human? Has it taught you wonderful things? Are you better, richer, wiser? Then let's see you answer this... which one of them do you want us to kill? Maid or Matron? Your friend, or your lover? Your choice!"

 Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are

But the thing is, we don't anymore. Wonder, that is. We haven't for a while because science has figured out all that there is to figure out. Mankind has come too far, too too far, crossed too many points-of-no-return and kept on barreling through till the last bits and pieces of wonder were shattered. People don't wonder anymore. People don't dream. People just know.

We know that there are 42, not 48, other civilizations in our galaxy; Douglas Adams must be so damn proud (and the Drake Equation was always more of a guestimate anyway, nowhere near as accurate as Science Fiction). Then again, reality has always been stranger than the mind has the capacity to imagine. Maybe that's why it stopped imagining. It got tired of being outdone.

"Jimin! C'mon! You're gonna miss the game!"

"Shut the fuck your face, I'm coming!" Jimin takes the steps by bounds and leaps, jumping up to tap the wooden doorframe even as he zooms through it to crash onto the old, worn couch in front of a holographic projector. Jungkook is perched right next to it, chewing on his nails. Jimin swats at him.

"Stop that."

"You're not my mom."

Jimin quirks an eyebrow, fixing Jungkook with a look. "Really? You wanna go there?"

"Alright, alright, I'll stop. Wait, wait, it's starting--I swear to every single galaxy in the entire universe that if Russia takes another Championship I'm gonna stuff an entire shuttle up my ass."

Jimin lets out a bark of a laugh and elbow Jungkook in the side, "You sure you'd be able to fit that shuttle in? Your head's already taking up so much space in there."

Jungkook shoves Jimin's face through the hologram and it looks like the opening shot goes right through his forehead.

Zero-gravity football (soccer some people used to call it) is kind of outdated, but still a crowd favorite. Well, as much of a crowd as there is left. Most people have already left Earth and they can't get signals beyond Jupiter so there's literally no chance of the Higher Classes catching this game. Not that the Higher Classes still watch zero-grav football. They've probably come up with something classier and indefinitely more expensive by now.

"I used to want to be a football player," Jimin says, settling into the couch, reaching across Jungkook for a bag of fries.

"I thought you wanted to be a pilot." Jungkook doesn't even take his eyes off the game, but his fingers dig through the fry bag and he shoves a handful in his mouth. Jimin shrugs. They both hoot as Korea takes a shot.

"No you wanted to be a pilot," Jimin corrects. Jungkook pauses with another handful of fries halfway to his mouth, a tiny frown creasing his forehead.

"Oh, right, I did." Then he shoves the entire handful in his mouth and chews. Jimin is licking his fingers clean of the salt, smacking his lips.

"Goal!" Jungkook punches the air and Jimin crumples up the empty fry-bag and lops it over the hologram straight into the garbage disposal. It hisses as the bag disintegrates and lets out a small puff of oxygen mist.

In 22010, there isn't much that humans haven't achieved, not much that we have not conquered or destroyed. No last frontier of science because that was ages ago, literally. But one thing hasn't changed--things live, and things die. And well, if the Earth is a living body, then humans were the cancer that it couldn't find a cure for. And so, it's dying.

But not before the universe put up a pretty good fight. How do you fight cancer? Well, radiation of course.

When the first wave of gamma rays hit from Eta Carinae, people weren't ready, though they thought they were. Billions died, millions more were diagnosed with diseases that all culminated in fatalities. Plants withered, birds and animals littered the streets by the hundred thousands, what few scientists remained not so much as crossed off species from the list but ripped out entire pages and burned them. The world population was cut down by more than half, almost overnight, and the results were nothing short of devastating. In the years that followed, that half was once again halved by the aftershocks of the radiation, and then halved again by the fallout, reducing the world population to barely an eighth of what it used to be.

Everyone thought it was finally time for humans to go.

But cancer isn't that easily cured. And neither is humanity.

We might call it resilience, the world might call it pestilence. Either way, the people who did survive came up with plans, answers, ways, as we always have, and life carried on, under clothes made to deflect gamma rays. Mechanics and scientists even developed a way to turn that radiation into usable energy and civilization thrived again.

Up above the world so high.

And that was when we really started looking up towards the stars. That was when people started to realize that our time here really is coming to an end, and that if we don't get out, the world will die, and we would die right with it. Some people might call it a noble way to go but most people just wanted out, nobility go screw itself in the backseat.

So, the World Council came up with a plan, a desperate, crazy plan, but a plan nonetheless--send 42 ships off into space, towards the known civilizations in our galaxy and hope against hope and against hope that some of them make it. Of course, there are safer civilizations, the ones that people have made contact with, weak as the radio signals were, strange as the messages were, long as it took to decode, but contact was made. And, given the significantly lowered population of the world, it wouldn't be a far shot from splitting what remained of the world into 42 different ships and sending them off. And that's exactly what happened.

Only, it’s more complicated than that. It's always more complicated than that. How do you decide who gets to go first? Who gets to go to the "safer" civilizations, and who gets sent on a joyride towards the edge of our galaxy without knowing if the ship will ever reach the civilization we've never made contact with?

Rewind 20 thousand years, give or take a century or so and a ship named the Titanic sunk to the bottom of the ocean.

And, while history doesn't repeat but it sure as hell does rhyme.

The rich and influential go first, go to the safest. The lesser fortunate go last. So it's been for all of humanity, and so it shall be till the end of the world's days. Literally. Oh the beauties of social hierarchy.

A ship goes out about every half year or so, because that's how long it takes to recharge the power plant with enough energy to launch a ship into space far enough for it to reach wherever it needs to go; the second to last ship left about six months ago.

"Three points! We're ahead by three points!" Jungkook is shaking Jimin by the shoulders. They're both jumping up and down on the sofa. It creaks and squeaks under their weight but it holds.

"Five more minutes and we'll end first quarter with a three point lead!" Jimin shouts back, and sure enough, five minutes later, the pair of them are tumbling off the sofa, laughing and shouting. It's the first time in two whole centuries that anyone other than Russia's gotten the World Championship.

"There's a party going on at Jackson's tonight," Jimin says as the game breaks for commercials. They're playing old reruns of ads for outdated things--teleporters, hovercrafts, etc.

"There's always a party at Jackson's." Jungkook is rummaging around the kitchen for more snacks and comes up empty. "We need to do some shopping."

Jimin snorts. "With what cash?"

Jungkook rolls his eyes. "Who needs that when you've got the five finger discount?"

Jimin heaves a sigh. Jungkook pauses in his last sweep of the kitchen and eyes Jimin.

"Oh, c'mon, it's not like we haven't been doing this for years. Thought you would have gotten used to it by now."

Jimin makes a noncommittal noise and slumps back into the sofa, "Call me old-fashioned but, I dunno, stealing just doesn't sit right with me."

"Do we have any other choice?" Jungkook makes his way back over to the sofa and leans his arms on the back, peering down at Jimin. His eyes are alight with something a little bit dangerous, a little bit devilish.

"Suppose not..." Jimin glances at him and right then, Jungkook drops an apple on his face.

"Ow! Shit--! That really--hey, where'd you get an apple from?" Jimin scrambles up, rubbing at his nose, the apple in his hand, hard and smooth and shiny.

"Guy down the street used to own an orchard--I've been taking care of a few things in there at night, you know the trees that are close enough to pull that gamma tarp over? And you said you missed fruits and stuff, so... yeah." He trails off at the end, scrunching his nose and scuffing his feet against the floor.

"How'd you learn how to garden?" Jimin asks, eyebrows in danger of disappearing into his hairline, even as he takes a large bite of the apple and almost groans out in satisfaction. It's sweet, and crunchy, and right now, it's just about the last good thing left on this whole damn Earth, except for Jungkook of course.

Jungkook waves a hand and jerks his head, motioning for Jimin to follow. They make their way through the long hallway of the abandoned house, down to the door leading to the basement. For the most part, they haven't been in there yet--it's only been a couple of weeks since they've moved in and stretching tarp over literally every inch of the roof is a tedious task, but completely necessary for ancient houses like these.

The basement is damp and dark. Jungkook clicks on his pocket fuse and the room lights up with a soft, blue glow.

"Whoa..." Jimin's eyes go wide.

"Right?" Jungkook says, grinning as he lifts the fuse higher to cast the light about. The basement is chalk full of books. Encased in Plexiglas and sealed tight into boxes of transparent alloy. Books, like the ones they've only seen in museums and in holographic projectors (back when they still snuck around into public schools for lessons). Hundreds upon hundreds of books, their titles in stacked letters, some of them recognizable, others in languages long lost to the ravages of time and the ruthless pace of change.

"This one here, is on gardening. I found it the other night when you woke me up from snoring too loudly," Jungkook says, bending down to push open the lid of a Plexiglas’s case, pulling out a tattered volume with a bright yellow and black striped cover--Gardening for Dummies.

"Dummies?" Jimin reads, smirking, but Jungkook makes to jab him in the side and he lowers his eyes back to the book. The pages smell like history, proper history, and stories. So, so many stories.

"Right here's the chapter on apple trees, and then over here... there are these fruits call 'cherries' before The First Wave. Y'know."

"They look yummy."

"Sure do," Jungkook says as he flips to another page, the pair of them settling down on the dust-covered basement floor, a pocket fuse between the two of them, huddled over the pages of a book that holds the stories of people from thousands of years ago.

They miss the entire football game and Jackson's party but neither of them can remember to care anymore.

Like a diamond in the sky.

Nighttime is the only time it's really safe to go outside without a thick layer of processed fabric clothing on. Nighttime usually finds Jungkook and Jimin splayed out across the roof, staring up at the stars, and tonight, it is no different.

"Which one do you think we'll go to?" Jimin asks.

"That one," Jungkook says, pointing.

"Hm... that one doesn't look so great, what about that one?" Jimin points to another one.

"What's wrong with the one I picked?" Jungkook lets his hand fall.

Jimin shrugs, "Nothing, I just like that one better." His hand falls too and their palms find each other, pressing, fingers lacing.

"What if I wanted to go to the one I picked?"

"Then I'd come with you."

"Even if you liked the other one better?"

"Of course."

Silence.

Jungkook gives Jimin's fingers a squeeze, turning round to face him.

"We can go to your star."

"I thought you liked the other one better," Jimin grins, turning his head to catch Jungkook's eye.

"Nah, changed my mind."

Jimin squeezes back. They close their eyes and doze to the sound of the wind through the air, thicker than it was before, more solid as it slides against their cheeks and their skin, pulling at their hair with its long, thin fingers, tugging right on the edges of their dreams. They fall asleep to the sound of each other's breathing--the last song the world will ever sing.

Morning comes with the rare chirrup of bird-song, because humans aren't the only creatures who are resilient and Darwinism still stands, gamma radiation or not. Things learn and die and adapt, things grow and shift and become. Things seek out ever more ways to survive, to live.

"Wake up, c'mon, the sun's gonna be up soon and we'll burn out here if we don't get inside." Jungkook is tugging on Jimin's arms. Jimin stirs with a huge yawn and blinks up at Jungkook, a soft smile on his face.

"Morning." His voice is thick and sticky.

"Morning," Jungkook says, blandly as he gives Jimin's arm another tug, eyeing the horizon. It's brightening by the second and they needed to get inside quick if neither of them wanted second degree burns. The atmosphere has deteriorated so much over the past twenty thousand years that the only reason oxygen is still plentiful enough is for the thin lattice of nanofibers braided and set over the entire world to keep oxygen atoms in, but they're not designed to keep the sun's harmful rays out. That's what the clothes and the tarps are for and staying in the sun too long, even far as it is now, could be deadly.

"Alright, alright, I'm up. I'm up." Jimin climbs to his feet, gathering their quilt from beneath him, almost stumbling as Jungkook pulls him to the edge of the roof, hopping down the ladder towards the ground, jumping the last two rungs and landing with a drop and a roll. Jimin follows after, still yawning, at a decidedly slower pace, and Jungkook is tapping his feet a mile a minute, holding the back door open for Jimin when he comes through.

"So chivalrous," Jimin says, grinning, voice still sleepy and soft.

"I try," Jungkook says, rolling his eyes.

Jimin sets the quilt on the sofa and curls up again, outside the sun is rising, the windows darkening over to keep the most harmful rays out. Jungkook shakes Jimin by the shoulders.

"Get uppp, I thought we were gonna go read today."

Jimin mumbles something and swats at Jungkook's hand, who sighs and leans closer.

"One more time in a language I understand?"

"You can... read... I'm gonna... sleep."

"Ugh," Jungkook lets out an exasperated groan and pushes away from the sofa. Jimin barely registers the thumpthumpthump of his footsteps down the stairs to the basement, or the decidedly slower thumps as he comes back up. But he does feel the weight the dip of the sofa under a decidedly heavier weight than he knows Jungkook is. Jimin peers down at Jungkook through one half-opened eyelid. Jungkook has a stack of books on his lap, the Gardening for Dummies propped up against the top, nose buried in it.

Jimin closes his eyes, "What's it say?"

"I thought you wanted to sleep." Jungkook's voice is flat, but the hitch tells Jimin that he's gloating. He loves gloating.

"I do."

"Then why do you wanna know what it says?"

"Curious."

"How're you gonna read it if you're sleeping?"

"Read it out loud."

"What?"

Jimin opens one eye again, a grin slipping over his lips, "Read it out loud. Then I'll know what it says and not have to read it myself. And I like your voice--you have a nice voice. I hear you singing in the public showers all the time."

Jimin can't really tell if it's the morning light hitting Jungkook's face at just the right angle, or if he's just blushing too hard, but the effect is nice. Jungkook's cheeks are a soft shade of morning pink, dipping in gold as he takes a deep breath and lowers his eyes to the page.

Jimin had never known so many things about cherry blossoms but he thinks that pretty as they may be, they'll never be quite as pretty as Jungkook's blush that morning.

"I've decided that cherry blossoms are my favorite flower," Jungkook says that night, their shoulders pressed, looking up at the night sky.

"You haven't even seen a real one before."

"Yeah, I know, but I saw them in that book and they're really pretty. And maybe when we get to this new planet and make friends with the people there, we can convince them to plant some."

"Jungkook, you know that they're extinct right? Where are you gonna get the seeds?"

Jungkook turns his head to give Jimin a look, "You wanna tell me that we've been able to genetically engineer human beings, control the entire genome down to the last letter, and we won't be able to reproduce a cherry tree seed to plant on whatever planet we're gonna land on?"

Jimin huffs. "Alright, alright. Point taken," and then he sighs, wistful and soft, "think it'll be nice there? Wherever we're going?"

"Better be--I'm trying to start the first ever zero-grav team there."

"All you need is a ball and a zero-grav field. That can literally be done anywhere in space cause no gravity in space, remember?"

"Yeah, but how awesome would it be to have like, aliens versus humans games?" Jungkook is grinning too wide.

"You're so weird--one second you're talking about planting cherry trees, the next you're talking about orchestrating zero-grav football games between two species." Jimin shakes his head and lets out a laugh.

"What can I say? I'm a man of many interests."

Jimin scoffs, but it turns into another laugh and he's nodding, "Of course you are--hey," he lifts his head up from the quilt and reaches around him, pulling out a book, a thin book, and flipping open the cover, digging a pocket fuse out to shine it on the pages.

"Which one's that?" Jungkook asks, turning onto his stomach, chin resting against Jimin's shoulder.

"The Little Prince," Jimin says, pointing to a picture of a tiny blond-haired boy standing on a planet with flowers and tiny mountains.

"Is it good?" Jungkook asks as Jimin flips to the first page. He shrugs.

"Dunno yet."

By the time they finish, the both of them feel like their hearts are going to pump right out of their mouths and they go to sleep promising each other to always love sunrises more than sunsets. And Jimin decides that this is his favorite book of all time.

Notices fly through every single holographic device in the entire world--the last ship is leaving in two days. Bring only what you need and nothing else. Supplies will be provided on the ship and partitioned after the headcount has been completed. Please check to make sure you are on the registered name list to confirm your space upon the spacecraft.

"We've confirmed, right?" Jimin asks, peering over the top of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Jungkook is sitting at the other end of the sofa, speeding through Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

"Hm? Oh--yeah we have. We got the space assignments too, the same bunk bed. But I used our birth certificate names," Jungkook says with a sheepish grin, "so we'll have to check in at different lines but we'll meet up back inside."

"Good," Jimin says, eyes lowering back onto the page.

Two days pass in a flurry of words, faster than the flip of a page.

The check in times are blocked off, mainly to keep the teleportation stations from flooding, and too many people trying to access the same end point might cause glitches in the system (horrible accidents in the past). Jungkook and Jimin are slotted for the last batch of people leaving.

"Orphans, duh," Jungkook says when Jimin asks why they're always last in line for everything.

"Right, right," Jimin says, slumping down next to him, watching the clock on the wall tick down mankind's last couple of hours on Earth. It's weirdly symbolic, that the last people on Earth would be those at the bottom of the social class, misfits and orphans.

When the time finally comes, they decide to leave the books. They're heavy and not worth the weight when teleporting--might screw up the algorithm if their masses are too off and they can't use an entire teleportation ticket for just books, they only have two.

"I'll meet you inside, okay?" Jungkook says, waving as he bounds off towards the line for the J's

"Yeah!" Jimin heads in the other direction for the P's. The lines are long, but they move at a decent pace. Still, it's been an hour and Jimin feels like they haven't moved much at all. Something crinkles beneath his foot as he takes another step and he looks down. It's a teleportation ticket. He bends down to pick it up, smoothing the thin material over his palm. An idea clicks in his head and he grins, turning to the old man behind him.

"Could you please save this spot for me? I forgot something back home and I gotta run to get it."

The old man nods and smiles a toothless smile. Jimin bows low, then shoots off towards the nearest teleportation stand.

Jungkook finally makes it through the sea of people inside, pushing passed them all till he reaches their bunk room. It's tiny, small as a closet, with just two beds and a small light attached to the head of each bed along with the bare necessities needed for daily life. There are two sets of immaculately folded clothes laid out on the sheets. Neither of them have been touched. Jungkook bounces on his feet, looking up and down the curved hallway before he decides to change now and then go find Jimin.

The mess hall is just that, a mess and Jungkook grabs two apples, shoving one in his pocket, popping the other one in his mouth before moving along the various tables and rotating trays, filling his arms with more food than he's had in... ever. He lays them all out on a table, then scans the room--no Jimin to be found. His stomach tightens, but he brushes it off. There are literally tens of thousands of people on this ship, of course he's not going to find Jimin right off the bat. It'd be nice though.

He'll be there when we go to sleep, he loves sleep too much to skip out on that, Jungkook things as he polishes off his apple and proceeds to stuff his face till he can't fill his stomach anymore. The spaceship rumbles to a start and people cheer as it finally lifts off. Jungkook takes up as much food as he can in his arms and goes back to his bunk, dumping all the food on the lower bed before climbing up the stepladder to peer into Jimin's bed.

The clothes are still folded, the linens still pristine and wrinkle free.

Jungkook frowns. Why hasn't Jimin changed yet? He can't enjoy being in those tattered old clothes they were wearing. Something very startling and increasingly unpleasant blooms in the back of Jungkook's mind but it can't be. He takes a deep breath and makes for the central commands.

The cockpit is barred off by a low set of metallic strings so that the people sitting in the giant lounge can see all the happenings inside, even talk to the crew if they fancied, keep an eye on the ETA and check their progress through the galaxy. The ship has cleared the Earth's atmosphere and is slowly making its way towards Mars. When they clear the last of Jupiter's moons, and only then can they go into light-speed travel. Any time before that and the power of the ship might affect gravitational forces of the first four planets and the point is to leave a much intact as possible.

"Hey, excuse me? Uhm, did everyone make it onto this ship?" Jungkook pulls himself up onto the raised platform of the cockpit and is greeted by a gentle-faced man with a stern smile.

"We haven't yet been able to recount the data, but that shouldn't be more than a couple minutes more. Is there someone you're looking for?"

"Yeah, Jimin, Park Jimin," Jungkook says, raising his fingers to his lips as if to chew on his nails but he catches himself last second and lowers his hand back down.

"Quite a common name," the man says, pulling up a list of names and scrolling through them. Jungkook watches, rocking on the balls of his feet.

"Do you know how old he is?"

"Uhm.... no? We're orphans... don't really keep track of that stuff."

"Ah, I'm very sorry to hear that," the man's voice softens along with his eyes as he lowers them back onto the scrolling list. Little green checks connected to each name and Jungkook hopes against hope that one of them is Jimin. His Jimin.

"Where is he from?"

"Busan. It's a tiny little district--we're both from there--"

"Ah yes," the man says, nodding as the scrolling slows and he pauses over one tiny little red x marked next to a Park Jimin, Busan. He frowns, "It seems that he might have missed check in but I'm sure after the second round of confirmations, we'll find him. No one's missed a ship since the third one took off."

Jungkook takes a deep breath through his nose. His heart is pounding somewhere in his temples and his fingers feel cold, his neck too hot, the space around him doesn't have enough oxygen and he feels his vision slip in and out of focus.

"Just another minute or so before the second round of confirmations come in," the man says, tapping the refresh button at the top right corner of his list.

Jungkook closes his eyes and tries to keep still, tries to keep himself from tipping right over and falling off the edge of the raise platform. This cannot be happening.

"Ah..." the man's voice does not bode well.

"What?" Jungkook bites, eyes snapping open. There's still a little red x next to Jimin's name.

"It... it seems that he didn't make it onto the ship. And the final headcount did come up to one person short."

"What do you mean he didn't make it onto the ship?" Jungkook's fingers curl into fists, his voice low and shaky as his mind buzzes and blanks out to a field of white, noise and heat colliding and melting till he can't think for the rush of blood behind his ears.

"He... he's not on the ship. I'm sorry."

"Sorry? Why are you sorry?" Jungkook blinks and forces himself to breathe again, his mind untangling bits of logic, stringing it around his throat, pulling tight, "we just have to turn the ship around and go get him."

"I'm... I'm very sorry, but we can't do that."

"Why not?" His teeth are gritted so tight the words barely make it out coherent.

"We can't just turn back around and land the ship again--"

"Why the fuck not?" Jungkook takes a step forward and immediately, another man appears by his side, tall and broad-shouldered, placing a firm hand on Jungkook's arm.

"Please, sir, it would be wise for you to calm down."

"You left my friend behind! My friend is back there! On Earth, the last person on Earth and you left him there!" Jungkook's throat aches with the words he's shouting but he almost doesn't hear them over the sound of his fear, his agitation, disbelief, every single emotion he'd never thought he'd be able to feel surging up through his arteries and bones, sizzling up and down his spine, curling around his ribcage, constricting his lungs, his throat, his heart, his heart, his heart.

There are tears running down his face. He doesn't realize till he tastes them on his lips.

"We have to go back! My friend--my best friend is back there! We have to go back!" He's trying to claw his way to the pilot's seat, as if he could somehow turn the ship around himself, but the second man has him in a vice-grip, holding him with an arm around his waist.

"We can't," the first man says, voice wavering but final in its tone, "because it will take another six months for the launch pad to power up again, and... and" his voice falters as he swallows--Jungkook lets out a ragged, broken sob--"and we powered down the atmospheric lattice generators when we left. We assumed... we assumed that it would no longer be necessary, given the... circumstances. So the oxygen supply will the depleted by morning."

"Y-you... you turned off the..." Jungkook's cry gets cut off in his throat.

"I'm very sorry... there's nothing we can do."

"Fuck that--fuck that--we're going back! I don't care if it takes another six months--we can all stay in this damn ship if we have to--" he's shaking his head as if it could rid him of the truths spilling over his cheeks onto the ground, shaking his head as if it would help him clear away the myriad of memories of Jimin. Jimin and his laugh like that space between closing your eyes and falling asleep. Jimin with his hands that are so small but strong enough to knock the air out of Jungkook's chest that one time they tried to teach each other boxing from a book. Jimin with his smile like sunrise and eyes like stars. Like diamonds in the sky.

"He's just one person," the first man says, and he sounds like he's trying to convince himself more than anyone else, "we can't endanger the lives of tens of thousands of people for just one per--"

"But he's my one person--he's my only person..." Jungkook's body goes slack and the arm around his waist loosens. A crowd has gathered around the cockpit, watching the entire scene unfold like some gross spectacle in a circus show.

"He's the only family I have... that I've ever had," he barely hears his own words over the sound of his breathing, can barely taste them over the sadness settling on his tongue, the aftertaste of a bad, bad nightmare that refuses to go away.

"Yer... not talkin' bout a little boy, bout yer age... shorter, with dem cheeks, are ya?" An old man's stepped out of the crowd. People are murmuring and muttering, stepping back to make room.

Jungkook's head snaps up and he almost falls over the edge of the platform. "Yes! That's him! Have you seen him? Is he here? Where is he? Is he--"

"Said he had t'go get summat he fergot at home... sounded real important n' told me t'look after his place in line fer him. Ne'er did see him come back." The old man shifts his hat on his head and heaves a deep sigh.

"And you just let him go?" Jungkook makes to launch himself forward but the second man's strong arm finds its way around his middle again and it knocks the wind right out of him.

"We can try to make radio contact," the first man's voice says from behind Jungkook. It is soft, imploring, almost desperate. Try as they might, hearts are still made of soft things, tissue and blood and muscle. Things that wound easy. Things that tend to scar instead of heal. "Would that be okay?"

Jungkook is gasping for breath that isn't there but he nods. He nods and nods and nods.

After a flurry of whispers in a language Jungkook swears he doesn't know, and a mess of beeps and click and soft static, the first man speaks into a small microphone on a long cord.

"Hello? Is anyone there? Does anyone hear me?"

And then, like a piercing shard of clarity, painful enough to clear the mind, comes Jimin's voice.

"H-hello? Is someone there? Hello?"

"Jimin! Jimin, oh fuck Jimin, can you hear me? Can you hear me?" Jungkook grabs at the microphone as the man hands it to him and clutches it to his mouth like it could not only save him, but everyone else on this ship.

"We won't be able to get you on a private line because the signal is too weak," the man whispers, close to Jungkook's ear, "and once we clear Jupiter's moons, we'll lose radio distance... but you have a little while."

Jungkook nods without really hearing the words, too intent on the breaths coming from the large speakers above him. He could almost hear Jimin's heartbeat, feel it beneath his cheek as he presses his face against the cool of the wall, trying to hold down his hiccups.

"Jungkook? Oh shit--is that you?"

"Y-yeah, it's me. What the hell did you go back to grab? You know you missed the ship, right?"

"Yeah... figured that one out myself. I... I picked up a teleportation ticket on the ground and figured that... well, you said you wanted to plant cherry trees when we got to this new planet right? So... I came back to grab your gardening book." He sounds sheepish; Jungkook can almost see the embarrassed little smile on his face as he scratches the back of his neck.

"You went back for a book?" Jungkook lets out a strangled laugh and lets his head thump back against the wall, back pressed to it, knees drawn into his chest.

"I wanted to surprise you."

Jungkook feels tears prickling at the edges of his eyes again as he digs a small, thin book from the large pocket in his new pants. The Little Prince. "Me too."

The silence fills the room; no one is talking, all of them looking at the boy curled up against the wall, cradling the speaker to his cheek, a book resting in his lap, an entire ocean caught in his eyelashes.

"We're coming back for you," Jungkook says, wiping at his tears. The first man snaps around and is about to say something when Jungkook swipes his hand across his own neck a couple of times--don't. The man falters and keeps quiet.

"You are?"

"Hell yeah we are. I'll pilot this damn ship myself if I have to."

"You've always wanted to be a pilot."

"I did," Jungkook says, a small laugh pressing passed his lips. Jimin's always remembered, even when Jungkook didn't, "and now I am--I guess dreams really do come true."

This time, Jimin laughs. And to Jungkook, it sounds like damnation. It sounds like salvation.

"It'll take a while though, we're pretty far out, so... you should probably get some sleep or something. You love sleep."

"Yeah..."

"Jimin?"

"Yeah?"

"We'll... we'll be there by morning. Captain promised." Jungkook bites down hard on his tongue. The Captain's got a pair of in-ears in but he glances over with a sad little smile before his eyes refocus on the twenty or so screens in front of him. A momentary slip-up and everyone on this ship is a goner. Jungkook thinks that it might not be so bad right now.

"He did?"

"Yep, he did, so you should really get some rest. You gotta wake up at the asscrack of dawn and you're shit at waking up without me."

Jimin laughs again and Jungkook swallows, letting his eyes fall shut. "And you better hold onto that book. We're gonna need it when we land in on the new planet."

"I won't lose it, I promise."

"Good."

Another silence. Jungkook soaks in the sound of Jimin's breaths and wonders if he could give up his own for Jimin's. If he just held his breath long enough, he could somehow send his lost-breath through the speaker to Jimin, to keep him alive for--

"What star are you going to?" Jimin asks, breaking the silence. His voice is fuzzy with static. The man points at a screen with a map of the solar system. The ship is closing in on the first of Jupiter's moons.

"Your star. We're going to your star," Jungkook says, letting his head drop between his knees to steady his breathing, "The one you picked out that night we were on the roof."

"Really?"

"Yeah, it'll be a long way there so you should--"

"Really rest up, I know, I know," Jimin's voice is indulgent and it seeps into Jungkook's skin, sticking like the apple juice that slicks down your fingers when you take too big of a bite.

"Its sunset, you know," Jimin says after another brief break. The static is getting worse, half-syllables breaking off. Jungkook glances at the screen--halfway to the last of Jupiter's moons.

"Is it pretty?" he asks, running a finger over the cover of The Little Prince, tracing the title.

"Too pretty."

"Sunrise is still prettier," Jungkook says, but he hears the choke in his own voice and has to swallow again.

"It's getting dark... and cold," Jimin says, and for the first time, Jungkook picks out the waver in Jimin's voice, and it isn't the static.

"You should sleep, close your eyes and sleep. You're at home, right?"

"Y-yeah... the sofa's really big when you're not squishing me off it."

Jungkook chuckles and curls his free hand into a fist so tight his knuckles go white, "Well you get it all to yourself tonight."

"Jungkook?"

"I'm here."

"I'm... I'm scared."

"Don't be," Jungkook fights and fights and fights to keep his voice steady. Three more moons. "I'm right here, okay? Right here. Uhm..." he casts about for something else to say, eyes settling on the large window out to the universe beyond. "Close your eyes and try to sleep. I'll sing you a song, okay? You said you always wanted to hear me sing."

Jimin's breath comes in a small hiccup, "Yeah... I guess dreams really do come true."

"Lie down and close your eyes, okay?" Two more moons. The crowd shifts. The old man at the front takes off his hat and presses it to his chest, eyes downcast.

"Okay."

"Twinkle, twinkle, little star--" Jungkook lets out a tiny sob. They're passing the last moon. Jimin's voice echoes out of the static-ridden speakers--

"How I wonder what you are--"
